The man who died on the 210 Freeway was identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Jutiapa, Guatemala, according to the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which said the Guatemalan consulate had confirmed the identity. Cellphone video from the deadly crash appears to show a passerby on the 210 Freeway, showing the body of a man who has been hit by a car just yards from where federal officers were arresting day laborers below. I don’t think that is the case, but it ended up with a father, a brother being killed,” said Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. “Whether they were chasing him or not, the fact is that when you have operations of this kind, the first reaction of any human being is to run.” Many others in the same Home Depot parking lot also ran, according to people who witnessed or experienced the raid. “Some people ran regardless of their immigration status because nowadays, they don’t know if undocumented or documented people will be detained.” Mattias said he hurt himself while jumping a fence.

Article: Ruben Amorim was 55 seconds into a post-match news conference that lasted less than three-and-a-half minutes at Old Trafford on Sunday when he was asked a question that made him flinch back and raise his eyebrows in disbelief. It concerned his goalkeeper and whether he had given any consideration to picking veteran former England man Tom Heaton ahead of Altay Bayindir for the Premier League defeat by Arsenal. Events can change situations quickly when a transfer window is nearing its close and it has been established Andre Onana's former club Inter Milan are looking at bringing in a new goalkeeper. When it became apparent Gianluigi Donnarumma was likely to be available as he is no longer required at Paris St Germain, the word coming out of Old Trafford was the Italian goalkeeper would not be heading their way. After all, it couldn't have been any clearer who his first choice was when the 29-year-old was picked for the Europa League final in May even though he had made high-profile mistakes in the build-up to the defeat by Tottenham in Bilbao. However, while Amorim said in his pre-match news conference on Friday afternoon the Cameroon international was available to face Mikel Arteta's side, by kick-off, he had only three full training sessions behind him after suffering a hamstring injury early in July. In Onana's absence, Amorim thought Bayindir had performed well during a summer campaign across three countries in which United remained unbeaten and the 27-year-old had featured in three-and-a-half of the five games. It was on that basis Amorim concluded in order for players to believe his 'group' philosophy, it would be the wrong decision to axe Bayindir, who in his eyes had done nothing to deserve it, for Onana, whose fitness had to be taken on trust.

Article: Two days after Donald Trump’s failed summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared on Fox News and raised a familiar point about the Trump administration’s position. Rubio added, “Ukraine is going to have to accept things it doesn’t like, and Russia is going to have to accept things that it doesn’t like.” On CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” the secretary made a similar point, though host Margaret Brennan pressed him on a key detail that too often goes unsaid. Brennan asked about the potential for a “dangerous precedent” that the United States “now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force.” Rubio responded that Putin “has already seized land by force,” which was true, but which was also beside the point. “Are you demanding withdrawal?” the host asked, leading Rubio to respond: “In order to have a deal here to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. Olga Rudenko, the editor in chief of the Kyiv Independent in Ukraine, has a new opinion piece in The New York Times with a straightforward headline: “All Russia Needs to Do Is Go Home.” From the column: The meeting between Mr. For all of the complexities surrounding possible territorial “swaps,” security guarantees and diplomatic partnerships, there’s a far more straightforward solution just sitting there, waiting for attention: Putin could withdraw his forces from Ukraine. Trump has spent months insisting that Putin wants “peace,” and the Republican reiterated the point to Fox News’ Sean Hannity after his failed summit in Alaska, saying that he genuinely believes that the Russian dictator wants to “solve the problem.” But this doesn’t have to be complicated: All Putin has to do is decide to stop fighting the war he started. Ukraine proved to be far more formidable than Russia expected; Russia has paid a heavy price for its miscalculation; and Russia could decide — literally at any time — to simply end the unprovoked conflict.

Article: Former national security adviser explains toggle caption Mstyslav Cherno/AP/AP President Trump is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine. Going into his Alaska summit last week, Trump said the main goal was to negotiate a ceasefire deal, and he warned of "severe consequences" for Russia if that deal wasn't reached. The united front is posed to prevent a repeat of Zelenskyy's last visit to the White House, but it's also an opportunity to ensure Ukraine has a say in the negotiations. But the real question is, is President Trump actually looking for a true peace agreement or is he effectively taking President Putin's side and saying it's Ukraine that has to make a whole series of concessions? It's interesting to me that there is more nervousness around Zelenskyy coming than there was around Putin coming when Zelenskyy is supposed to be a friend, and we know that Putin is a foe. Fadel: What about this concession they say they did get, that they could offer security guarantees to prevent Russia from attacking again, something they say Putin has agreed to and they called it 'game changing?' Sullivan: Well, security guarantees are absolutely essential because over the long term, what Putin really wants is the subjugation of Ukraine. Sullivan: Well, President Biden took the position, which President Trump has also taken, that the United States will not directly enter the war against Russia with American forces on the ground. If President Trump, alongside Europe, really cranked up the economic pressure on Russia at a moment when their economy is weak, I do believe it would create more leverage to get a good deal, a true peace in Ukraine. And if you look at the Russian economic official speaking publicly about how their war machine is sputtering, now is the moment, in my view, to really tighten the pressure, especially with oil prices being where they are globally.

Article: The conservative cable news channel Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company Dominion over baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, according to a new regulatory filing. The timing was striking: Right around the time that Trump announced a renewed crusade against voting machines, based in part on his conspiratorial assumptions about the election equipment, the public learned of Newsmax’s settlement with one of the nation’s leading voting machine companies. It was just four months ago when a judge ruled that the far-right media outlet did, in fact, make defamatory statements about Dominion Voting Systems when it falsely claimed the company rigged votes in the 2020 presidential election, concluding that Dominion had presented “clear and convincing evidence” that the statements from Newsmax were false and would “likely cause reasonable viewers to think significantly less favorably about Dominion than if the viewers knew the truth.” That set the stage for a trial, at which point a jury would have decided whether the cable channel acted with “actual malice.” But it also opened the door to settlement negotiations, which apparently ended in an agreement. Finally, let’s not forget there’s still one big case pending: Fox News is facing a $2.7 billion lawsuit from Smartmatic, and as The New York Times reported, that case is set to proceed to trial in a Manhattan state court unless the parties reach a settlement.

Article: DENVER (AP) — The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday. The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network. “We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.” WATCH: Fox News to pay $787M settlement to Dominion Voting Systems over stolen election lies A spokesperson for Dominion said the company was pleased to have settled the lawsuit. The disclosure of the settlement came as Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies. The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. “How long are we going to play along with election fraud?” Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion’s earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network’s business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Trump’s 2020 election claims. Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. Though Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey’s work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.

Article: AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats said Monday that they were ending a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts as part of a national partisan brawl over President Donald Trump’s desire to reshape U.S. Their return will allow the Republican-run Legislature to proceed as California Democrats advance a counter-effort to redraw their congressional boundaries in retaliation — a tit-for-tat that puts the nation’s two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state more than two weeks ago to deny their Republican-majority colleagues the attendance necessary to vote on redrawn maps intended to send five more Texas Republicans to Washington. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu in a statement. The president wants to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him. Greg Abbott jumped to the president’s aid, adding redistricting to the agenda of an initial special session agenda that included a number of issues, but most notably a package of bills responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don’t have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades. At the start of Monday’s hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys’ constitutional concerns. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district. But Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district. The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren’t followed. The state’s lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine’s future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin.

Newcastle have seen several targets move elsewhere, and the Alexander Isak saga continues to hang over the club, but the black-and-whites have brought in Anthony Elanga, Malick Thiaw, Aaron Ramsdale and, now, Ramsey, who is a player Howe "loved" from afar. Ramsey certainly looks like a Howe player and the versatile midfielder was even ranked second for possessions won (15) in the final third for Aston Villa in the top-flight last season. Newcastle may be well-stocked in the middle of the park, but the 24-year-old's athleticism, ball-carrying ability and experience in the Premier League and Champions League will be invaluable as the club prepare to fight on four fronts.

Article: She was charged in the spring with allegedly assaulting federal officers at an immigration facility in Newark, New Jersey, while she was conducting oversight with other Democratic politicians amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. “The Department of Justice’s dismissal of prosecutions arising from the January 6 attack on the Capitol — including those of more than 160 defendants charged with violating the same statute upon which the indictment relies here — is robust evidence of unconstitutional differential treatment,” her lawyers wrote. They observed that the congresswoman’s alleged conduct was “manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray.” “There is a simple difference between this prosecution of Congresswoman McIver and the 160 cases involving assault against federal officers on January 6 that the Justice Department has dismissed: it is all about politics and partisanship,” her lawyers wrote, calling the differential treatment “precisely what the Constitution forbids.” The filing is a sobering reminder of the violence of Jan. 6 and what it says about an administration that made it a Day One priority to forgive scores of convictions (by way of clemency) and pending charges (by way of dismissals). Seeking to clear that high bar in her case, McIver, who pleaded not guilty, maintains that the DOJ “cannot pursue charges against her because she is a Democrat who conducts oversight of Executive Branch immigration policy, while dismissing charges brought under the same statute against those whose views they share and who engaged in conduct far more egregious.” The fate of McIver’s case doesn’t hinge on the success of this single motion. She filed it alongside others, including one that seeks to dismiss her case based on legislative immunity, in which her lawyers wrote that she’s charged in connection with “a congressionally authorized oversight inspection.” Legislative immunity is distinct from the presidential immunity that Trump won from the Supreme Court in his Jan. United States and its separation of powers rationale, her lawyers wrote in the immunity motion that the court’s reasoning in Trump’s case “applies with at least as much force in the context of legislative immunity,” given the latter doctrine’s concern with ensuring legislative independence.

Erin isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but forecasters at the National Weather Service office in Morehead City, N.C., warn that areas such as North Carolina's Outer Banks should be prepared for waves as high as 15 to 20 feet or more — and to expect days of potential flooding. Sponsor Message "Coastal flooding will likely be a long duration issue, impacting Highway 12," the NWS office said, warning that parts of the main highway running along the Outer Banks could be impassible for several days. The North Carolina transportation department said a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for all visitors to Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands, adding that the order will take effect for residents early Tuesday.

Article: Russia’s illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 was quick and bloodless, and it sent Moscow’s relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War. Putin has called the peninsula “a sacred place” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine — particularly the Crimean Tatars, who strongly opposed the annexation. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court’s finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. WATCH: What to expect from Zelenskyy’s next meeting with Trump, backed by European leaders Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it. A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor from Russia to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin called its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin’s prized asset — the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022, in July 2023 and in June 2025. Those also include Ukraine ceding the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022, dropping its bid to join NATO, keeping the country’s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population.

Article: Dominion filed a defamation suit against Newsmax in 2021 over false claims that its voting technology was used to rig the 2020 US presidential election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump. But Davis said he would leave it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. “Faced with these rulings and other constraints, Newsmax chose to settle the case.” “Newsmax has always maintained that its reporting was not defamatory and that its coverage was consistent with accepted journalistic standards,” the company said. Davis also handled the Dominion-Fox News case, and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were false. Though Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence to prove they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time.

Article: The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) has said Air Canada’s ongoing strike, in which 10,000 cabin crew members have walked off their jobs, is illegal after strikers ignored orders to return to work. Pushing for a resolution, Carney said, “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our countries are being disrupted by this action.” The airline normally carries 130,000 people daily during the ongoing peak summer travel season and is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines. The minority government could also try to pass legislation that would need the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of the Parliament of Canada, which are on break until September 15. “The government will be very reticent to be too heavy-handed because in Canada, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have to be very careful when they take away the right to strike, even for public sector-workers who may be deemed essential,” said Dionne Pohler, professor of dispute resolution at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations School. The previous government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy, but it is highly unusual for a union to defy a CIRB order.

Article: TEL AVIV — In the plaza that Israelis have christened “Hostage Square,” hundreds of thousands of people banged drums, shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his right-wing government. Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave’s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive. Among the demonstrators at Sunday’s protest was Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, an Israeli American soldier who was among the 1,200 killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. “Life comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.” The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians’ homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. While Sunday’s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed. “Those who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas’s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a “toxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.” Their government’s approach appears to have the backing of Trump.

Article: Sultana: Corbyn 'capitulated' on antisemitism definition Facing criticism from Jewish groups, with the Board of Deputies of British Jews calling her words "a grave insult", Sultana posted on social media that she was a proud anti-Zionist. Speaking to the New Left Review, Sultana praised Corbynism's mass appeal, but said he "capitulated" to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, saying it "equates it with anti-Zionism". Asked how the new party would adapt the model of radical politics Corbynism set out a decade ago, Sultana said he had made "a serious mistake" in being too conciliatory. "It capitulated to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which famously equates it with anti-Zionism, and which even its lead author Kenneth Stern has now publicly criticised." Sultana added the movement was "frightened and far too conciliatory" when it was attacked and should have recognised that the state and the media "are our class enemies" because, she said, "you cannot give these people an inch". "Exaggerating his role is a tactic to give undue weight to his controversial views." Mr Hearn added he hoped Sultana would "remain on the fringes of politics for the remainder of her career, which is where her extremist views belong". The vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Andrew Gilber, said the definition was also "supported by the overwhelming majority of British Jews as it is clear and measured in defining antisemitism". "Those who seek to delegitimise and mis-define the IHRA definition in this way prove themselves to be no friend to the Jewish community and also call into question their wider commitment to anti-racism, the wellbeing of the Jewish community and social cohesion."

Looking back now, though, he insists that the superlative was "totally incidental." "It's like their way of calling me a hammy kid, basically, which I was," he says. I would bring VHS tapes to school … and just, like, show people when there was a substitute teacher in class." Sponsor Message SNL wasn't the only show that left its mark on Yang; he initially studied chemistry and pre-med in college after becoming "obsessed" with Sandra Oh's character on Grey's Anatomy, Yang says. I actually wanted to be someone who was on TV.'" Yang says he never thought SNL would hire "an effeminate Asian man" for that show, but he was happy to be proven wrong. "Sit[ting] next to [SNL creator and executive producer] Lorne [Michaels] each week and hav[ing] him give notes on your sketch at dress rehearsal, you really develop this internal sense of, 'OK, I understand how the show works in this very underpinned way.'" In addition to his work on SNL, Yang had a part in Wicked, and is co-host of the popular podcast Las Culturistas with his friend Matt Rogers. Sponsor Message Interview highlights On growing up as the child of Chinese immigrants, and being obsessed with pop culture As a closeted Canadian kid who then moved to the States ... it was this big shock to move from French Canada — to move from Quebec — to Colorado, where I was speaking primarily French at school and Mandarin in the house, and suddenly I had to fast-track to English. … I had this visceral response to not wanting to watch that version of myself, like the person who, before he went down the chute of working at SNL, had no idea what the show was looking for. Lorne had reached out and sort of had his plan for how he wanted to cast the main players in the general election, and I was pretty resistant at first, and after a few more conversations, I think I dutifully acquiesced, and then I kind of went about it in the most child-of-immigrants way, where I hired a dialect coach, and I requested a screen test where I tried out different contact lenses, because I felt like so much of JD Vance's sort of visual eeriness was in his eyes. It was just an excuse for Matt and I to have a playdate every week, but we had done a lot of comedy together in the years leading up to it. … The awards kind of budded out of this one summer, I think in 2021, when we didn't have a guest booked that week … and that was not a common thing at the time. And so, then from that first year, we were like, "OK, so the goal is to get this televised so that everyone can opt into this." On lying as a kid that he'd seen Wicked Growing up it was this thing of like, well, if you didn't see Wicked then you have no business being a theater kid. It was really crazy how I was like, wow, this is all culminating into this moment where I'm finally seeing the show that has still meant so much to me. Sponsor Message On a piece of "cultural contraband" from his youth The only thing that I ever had to hide was a hardcover copy of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, because it was my sister's book. I was having a sexual awakening to classical art books and I highly recommend today's youth go about it the same way, because you were learning about art and you were figuring yourself out.

Article: The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in 2021 is underway Defendant Hernandez Govan, accused of orchestrating the killing of rapper Young Dolph, appears in court during his trial in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday, August 18, 2025. (Mark Weber/Daily Memphian via AP, Pool) Defendant Hernandez Govan, accused of orchestrating the killing of rapper Young Dolph, appears in court during his trial in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday, August 18, 2025. Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world. During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti’s brother, Anthony “Big Jook” Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph’s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were “looking for somebody” and “didn’t know who we were going to catch.” They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph’s car. At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Jermarcus Johnson, who pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the killing, acknowledged helping his half-brother and Smith communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, “King of Memphis.” He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. In a 2024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a “very senseless murder” and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.

At the center of the dispute are salary negotiations between Air Canada and the CUPE flight attendants union, which says the carrier's wages are below inflation, market value and the federal minimum wage. "CUPE illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy the direction from the CIRB to return to work resulting in Air Canada suspending its plan to resume limited flying by Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge," Air Canada said in a statement. As a result of the labor disruptions and grounded fleet, Air Canada announced Monday morning that the airline will suspend its third quarter and year end operating results and profit forecasts.

Article: Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa attend a press conference during their visit to the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, in Rafah, Egypt, August 18, 2025. Hamas has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal with Israel that includes the return of half the hostages held in Gaza and Israel's release of some Palestinian prisoners, an Egyptian official source said on Monday. Israel's plans to seize control of Gaza City in the heart of the Palestinian enclave have stirred alarm abroad and at home, where tens of thousands of Israelis on Sunday held some of the largest protests since the war began, urging a deal to end the fighting and free the remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Thousands of Palestinians fearing an imminent Israeli ground offensive have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, now under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south in the shattered territory. In an apparent show of force on Monday, Israeli tanks advanced into the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, according to witnesses who counted the presence of at least nine tanks and bulldozers. Israel's Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, said his country was at a turning point in the Gaza war, "with its focus on enhancing the strikes against Hamas in Gaza City," the military spokesman said in a statement. In a video issued by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "I, like you, hear the reports in the media, and from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure." The Egyptian official source stated that the proposal accepted by Hamas included a suspension of Israeli military operations for 60 days and outlined a framework for a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-old conflict. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the Qatari prime minister, joined the discussions on Monday and met both Egyptian President el-Sisi and Hamas representatives, said an official briefed on the meetings. Israel approved the plan to take control of Gaza City earlier this month, but officials had said it could take weeks to start, leaving the door open for a ceasefire, even though Netanyahu had said it would get under way "fairly quickly" and end the war with Hamas' defeat.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump expressed hope that their critical meeting Monday with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine. troops to the effort, saying instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence but that all those details would be hashed out in their afternoon meeting with EU leaders. “I think its very important to get the deal done.” WATCH: Zelenskyy brings Europe’s top leaders with him to meet Trump on ending Russia’s war Trump’s engagement with Zelenskyy had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelenskyy had shown insufficient gratitude for U.S. Here’s what to know “So let me just say three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections, oh, I wonder what the fake news would say,” Trump said. Monday’s hastily assembled meeting comes after Trump met on Friday with Putin and has said that the onus is now on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land that he said could end the war. The two will later gather with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy responded with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” Zelenskyy said in a social media post he met with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared “strong diplomatic capabilities” of the U.S., Ukraine and Europe. “We have to explore all possible solutions to guarantee peace, to guarantee justice, and to guarantee security for our countries.” The European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the U.S. Ahead of Monday’s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender” the news media and Democrats “would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. ‘A very big move’ European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.

Article: Health officials declared the outbreak over after more than 42 days without a new case, a cut-off based on the time between when a person is exposed to when they get sick. In late January, a cluster of cases was reported in western Texas near Gaines County -- near the border with New Mexico -- which had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state.

Texas health officials warned that the state is likely to experience additional cases this year given ongoing outbreaks in other parts of the U.S. The virus was declared eliminated by health officials in 2000 after a full year of no continuous spread, but declining vaccination rates have led to a growing number of outbreaks annually, experts say. "Vaccination rates in many communities remain far too low, leaving large pockets of children vulnerable to measles and other preventable diseases -- and that's why we're likely to continue seeing outbreaks," Brownstein said. The 2024-2025 school year had a record number of non-medical vaccine exemptions, with an estimated 286,000 kindergarteners attending school without documentation of receiving the shot that protects against measles, according to CDC data. "Measles isn't happening in isolation -- we're seeing a broader resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, from pertussis to polio threats, which underscores the urgent need to maintain high vaccination coverage and public trust in immunization," Brownstein added.

Article: DALLAS — Almost a dozen Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives refused to return to the state capitol on Monday with their colleagues despite the legislature now having enough members present for a quorum and to conduct business. The holdouts remain in suburban Chicago in a symbolic standoff against Governor Abbott who called the Texas legislature into a special legislative session to redraw congressional lines that will help President Trump keep control of Congress through the 2026 mid-term elections. I am focused on ensuring California passes its own maps which they must do by this coming Friday to ensure they nullify Trump and Abbott's power grab in Texas,” said state Rep. “But let me be clear: If Donald Trump and Greg Abbott bring their anti-Austin, anti-American redistricting scheme to the floor of the Texas House, I will return to represent my constituents and vote NO.” Despite the holdout, there were still enough Democrats who returned to the House chamber on Monday at 12 p.m. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said state Rep. Wu said last week that the quorum break would end if two conditions were met; the first special session ended and California introduced its own legislation to counteract what Texas Republicans want to do.

Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses," Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement Monday. Prior to their return, some Texas officials had called for federal help to locate out-of-state Democrats and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had sought to declare some of the absent lawmakers' seats vacant, among other efforts. We'll move quickly and the schedule will be demanding until our work is complete." After the House gaveled in Monday, House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced a quorum was present and said civil arrest warrants remain in place for lawmakers who remain out of state. Because breaking quorum is not a crime, federal authorities don't have means to compel lawmakers to return to the Texas Capitol, but within state lines, the lawmakers could be placed under civil arrest and brought back to Capitol.

Jason Fochtman | Houston Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty Images Then when it reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, Walmart said it would mitigate higher costs as much as possible, but would likely have to increase some prices at the current tariff rates. Walmart management briefed Trump this spring about the impact its accounting method may have on results in a high-tariff environment, according to a person familiar with the discussion, who asked to remain unnamed while speaking about private conversations. Still, James Bowie, managing director in EY's technical accounting advisory group, warned "all of the inventory costing methodologies will be affected in some ways." An employee folds towel at a Manhattan retail store on July 15, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images It typically takes a large, non-fast fashion retailer using RIM roughly two to four quarters for cost volatility to settle and profitability to get closer to its true level, according to PwC. It takes a little longer for it to turn and so even though they might ultimately be able to go the same speed, it takes a little bit of time for that one turn to take place." While RIM is more likely to lead to a temporary overstating of profitability, it can also wind up understanding profits if tariffs are negotiated lower. Bowie said if a retailer responds to lower tariff rates by cutting retail prices, under RIM accounting, "it looks like my margin has eroded, but it's only because I now am waiting for the cost relationship to catch back up, so [it] might look like there's margin compression even in a period of decreasing tariffs." Furman added that PwC is seeing "a clear disconnect" for companies that use RIM accounting. "[A retailer] had an abacus and a dream trying to figure out what you're going to do." Over time, technology made it easy to use actual costs rather than averages, so cost accounting became more common. CNBC US source For the purposes of this example, PwC and CNBC used weighted average cost accounting, which takes a SKU-level weight average and blends all costs together, regardless of purchase date. CNBC US source Tariff case 1: Retailer's costs increase, all else remains the same If the retailer's cost for each T-shirt goes up as a result of tariffs, but everything else — units bought, units sold and retail price — remains the same, gross margin falls if calculated using cost accounting and RIM. CNBC US source Tariff case 2: Retailer raises prices to offset higher costs If the retailer passes on the full dollar value of the tariff cost to the customer, and units bought and sold stay the same, gross margin improves under both accounting methods. Tariff case 3: Retailer raises prices and units bought and sold both fall Here's where it gets interesting, and likely more realistic, to reflect supply and demand choices a retailer and consumer would likely make as costs rise. If the retailer passes on the full dollar value of tariffs to the customer and also sells fewer items to consumers at the higher retail price, RIM makes profit margins look temporarily rosier.

Article: More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in its nearly two-year genocidal war on Gaza, with the population suffering relentless bombardment with nowhere safe in the besieged enclave, Israeli-induced starvation and the daily killing of people desperately seeking food for their families. Israel is intensifying strikes on Gaza City, the territory’s largest – and now destroyed – urban centre, as it plans to seize it and forcibly displace tens of thousands of people to concentration zones in the south. The scale of attacks illustrates how Israel’s current strategy is shaping the geography and demography of Gaza.” “We can see how Israel is using heavy artillery, fighter jets and drones, in order to destroy what’s left of residential homes there. People there say Israeli attacks are happening day and night.” Many who have already been displaced multiple times during the war by Israeli bombardment are on the move again from Gaza City. Advertisement But while many Palestinians who remain in the devastated city are forced to survive in the ruins of buildings, makeshift shelters, or tents, some people have told Al Jazeera that it would be impossible for them to leave. “We want them to [allow] us back to the homes we fled – we don’t need more than that.” Slight hope emerged as Hamas said it approved a Gaza ceasefire proposal put forward yesterday by mediators Qatar and Egypt. An informed source told Al Jazeera that the draft deal would ensure a 60-day truce that would see the release of half of the Israeli captives held in Gaza as well as an unspecified number of Palestinian captives imprisoned by Israel. But Palestinians in Gaza have seen countless false dawns before, and after a brief ceasefire in January was shattered by Israel in March, the war then entered its most grim phase of human misery. ‘Israel carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation’ Gaza’s Health Ministry says five more Palestinians have died from malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing monthslong blockade in the past 24 hours, including two children. The United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) warned that as of July 2025, more than 320,000 children – the entire population under the age of five in Gaza – are at risk of acute malnutrition. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says children in Gaza should be preparing for the new school year, but instead are searching for water, queuing for food, and living in classrooms turned into overcrowded shelters. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.” Advertisement In the meantime, Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says its staff in Gaza are witnessing a surge in mass casualties linked to Israel’s ongoing siege and its oversight of limited distribution of aid by the controversial, US- and Israel-backed aid organisation GHF. “The indiscriminate killings, and the counts of mass casualties we still [see] on a daily basis right now, hasn’t stopped, but only increased in its scale,” said Nour Alsaqqa of MSF. “They go out of desperation and they risk their lives to access aid, which is still inaccessible due to Israel’s siege.” Since the establishment of the GHF aid sites at the end of May, nearly 2,000 people have been killed while trying to access aid, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Article: The Wall Street Journal, citing a European official and another person also involved in planning the summit, reported that the "White House has asked that Zelensky don a suit and tie to meet the president." But when Zelenskyy showed up at the White House, he appeared to have bucked that reported request. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images file As Trump welcomed Zelenskyy to the Oval Office for that meeting in February, he panned his Ukrainian counterpart for his outfit by saying he was "all dressed up today.” At one point a reporter from the right-wing Real America’s Voice network asked Zelenskyy why he wasn't wearing a suit and said, “You’re at the highest level in this country’s office, and you refuse to wear a suit." Zelenskyy replied, “I will wear costume after this war will finish." (He also quipped: “Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don’t know.") The outfit Zelenskyy wore Monday seems to be his attempt to thread the needle between maintaining his independence while showing a bit of receptivity to pressure from the White House — and trying to get the best possible peace deal for Ukraine. But if the White House considered its demand that Zelenskyy conform to its sartorial wishes a test, Zelenskyy appears to have shown he was only willing to go part of the way.

Article: Nearly a year ago, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced off in their first and only presidential debate, and when the discussion turned to Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Democratic vice president told her Republican rival what he didn’t want to hear. As NBC News summarized: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from a nearly three-hour meeting on the Ukraine war and struck a cordial tone in brief public statements, but left without announcing a ceasefire or peace agreement. John McCain, a month before his death, went so far as to call Trump’s appearance in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.” But the second summit was, by most measures, even worse — because as the American president acknowledged, the stakes were vastly higher. Chris Murphy of Connecticut explained, simply, “Putin got everything he wanted.” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point: Trump handed Putin a victory before the summit even began by extending an invitation and giving the Russian leader the legitimacy he’s craved. Trump handed Putin a public relations victory in Alaska, literally rolling out the red carpet for the dictator, literally applauding him, welcoming him into the presidential limo, and treating Putin with deference, even letting the Russian leader speak first (and longer) at their pseudo press conference. Trump handed Putin a strategic victory by abandoning the White House’s own policy: The American president said he’s no longer seeking a ceasefire as a precursor to broader negotiations — the policy Trump spent months trying to secure — which necessarily strengthens Moscow’s hand. “For all the promises of a cease-fire, of severe economic consequences, of being disappointed, it took two minutes on the red carpet and 10 minutes in the Beast for Putin to play Trump again. When Fox News’ Sean Hannity asked the American president to rate the talks on a scale of 1 to 10, Trump replied, “I think the meeting was a 10, in the sense we got along great.” And if the point of the talks were for Trump and Putin to “get along great,” then it was certainly a triumph, but in Grown-Up Land, there were other objectives on the to-do list. “We’re not walking out of there with a deal,” a White House official told Politico ahead of the summit — hours before they walked out of there without a deal. As this week gets underway, Zelenskyy will meet with the American president in the White House, and he’s bringing some backup: The Ukrainian leader will be joined by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, U.K.

Article: Under normal circumstances, no one would think to ask the Pentagon whether the current secretary of defense supports women’s voting rights, but there’s little about our current political landscape that’s “normal.” Hence, The Hill reported: The Trump administration on Thursday sought to clarify Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s support for women’s voting rights following controversy spurred by his repost of a video tied to a pastor who said the opposite. I can appreciate why the DOD’s right-wing spokesperson — someone who, as Politico reported earlier this year, “has touted antisemitic views, white supremacist conspiracy theories and Kremlin-like statements on social media” — would be eager to dismiss the line of inquiry. In fact, it was just two weeks ago when Hegseth used his social media account to amplify a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote. Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the idea of repealing voting rights for American women, but he also didn’t make any effort to distance himself from the rhetoric used in the video he shared with his online followers. On the contrary, he promoted the video, alongside his own written message that read, “All of Christ for All of Life.” When this sparked a controversy, the former Fox News host could’ve made it clear that he disagreed with the comments, or that he supports leaving the 19th Amendment intact. When asked about the video he promoted, a Pentagon spokesperson told the AP that Hegseth is “a proud member of a church” that is affiliated with CREC and he “very much appreciates many of Mr.

Article: Richard Schlueter, 56, was planting cucumbers and squash in his community garden plot in Greensboro, Georgia, in May when he tore open a bag of soil and heard a pop. That day, he called a medical team at the National Institutes of Health that had created an experimental cell therapy, custom-made to attack his cancer as part of a clinical trial. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A week later, Schlueter and his wife, Michelle, saw NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya push back on concerns raised by his own staff that the ouster of essential employees and other disruptions to the biomedical research agency were harming science and patients. But on June 3, his NIH doctor informed him that it would now take eight to 10 weeks because of cuts to essential lab personnel — a painful illustration of the life-or-death stakes of the administration’s approach to shrinking the government workforce. You can imagine the difficulty as we have to tell them these things.” An official with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, said the agency had ways of addressing the delays. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A scan and biopsy showed it was head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but an oncologist told him it was treatable, with an excellent chance of success. He read the NIH credo — to improve the human condition throughout the world — emblazoned on a wall of the Clinical Center and was so moved that he sent a photo of it to his three children.

Two scientists on Rosenberg’s team who have specialized skills to prepare cells for immunotherapy trials were among the thousands of probationary employees fired in the Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal workforce.

Ferris, a head and neck surgical oncologist at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, said patients such as Richard have tough and tragic cases where standard medical care has been exhausted. “If he misses [it], not only is it is it devastating for his family, but it’s devastating for all the patients behind him that could have learned something scientifically — on why it was successful or not successful,” Michelle said. “He’s like a test pilot.” UPDATE: After Richard Schlueter shared his story with The Post, NIH was able to rehire the scientist who prepares the cells for the immunotherapy trial, and he was able to receive his treatment.

The latest terms are similar to those that Israel had previously accepted and they include both a temporary cease-fire and a path to an agreement to end the war, according to the two diplomats and the Egyptian official.

Article: “Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, the world’s largest online dictionary. “Skibidi” is a gibberish term coined by the creator of an animated YouTube series and can mean “cool” or “bad” or be used with no real meaning as a joke. Other planned additions include “tradwife," a contraction of “traditional wife” referring to a married mother who cooks, cleans and posts on social media, and "delulu,” a shortening of the word delusional that means “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.” Christian Ilbury, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, said many of the new words are tied to social media platforms like TikTok because that is how most young people communicate. Cambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than 2 billion words of written and spoken English, to monitor how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used, the company said. “If you look at what a dictionary’s function is, it’s a public record of how people use language and so if people are now using words like ‘skibidi’ or ‘delulu,’ then the dictionary should take account of that,” Ilbury said.

Article: Key takeaways so far from Ukraine talks in Washington 11 minutes ago Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr Reporting from the White House Laura Gozzi BBC News Share Save Watch: Key moments from Zelensky-Trump White House talks Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to the White House on Monday to meet US President Donald Trump for fresh talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Follow live updates on this story Zelensky launches charm offensive Given his acrimonious last visit to the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian president went to considerable lengths to be collegial and charm his American hosts - including a flurry of six "thank yous" within the first few minutes of the meeting. The last time he was at the White House, Zelensky was scolded by Vice-President JD Vance for a perceived lack of gratitude for US support for Ukraine during the war. This time, Zelensky was dressed in a dark suit rather than his traditional military garb, and appeared well prepared with a joke when asked about his outfit by the same reporter who had previously criticised him for not wearing a suit to the Oval Office. After the reporter told him that he looked "fabulous", Zelensky shot back that he was wearing the "same suit" as last time, eliciting laughter from the reporters, Trump and other officials in the room. Reuters The pair presented a warmer front on Monday - with comedian-turned-politician Zelensky joking about their first, acrimonious meeting Zelensky also sought to play to Trump's family during the meeting, handing the US president a letter from Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to Melania Trump. The delivery of the letter comes just days after Trump hand-delivered a letter from Melania to Vladimir Putin while in Alaska, in which she called on Putin to protect "the innocence" of children and "nurture the next generation's hope". And she says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow, because so many people have been killed." Trump hints at security guarantees One of the questions put to Zelensky was about what he would need from the US to guarantee his country's security. In a moment that conveyed the sense of urgency he seemingly tried to suppress throughout much of the press conference, Zelensky leaned forward in his chair and said, emphatically: "Everything." "We need a strong Ukrainian army," he added. But the lack of detail on what exactly these guarantees might consist of is concerning to both Kyiv and Europe, and behind closed doors leaders will no doubt try to impress on Trump that the US deterrent needs to be more than just symbolic.

Article: See today's video update from Mike above.) Stocks are idling to start a new week, holding just below record highs as Wall Street awaits some potentially consequential updates on the consumer and Federal Reserve policy. The S & P 500 was nearly flat, sitting in its narrowest daily range of the year, holding tight to its closing level both from Friday and last Tuesday, the day that a mostly benign Consumer Price Index report for July solidified expectations for a Fed rate cut next month. A modest majority of stocks were up on the day Monday, the equal-weighted S & P 500 barely was in the green, with the longtime laggard Russell 2000 small-cap gauge lifting by about 0.3%. Meta Platforms was by far the biggest drag on the S & P 500, down 2.2%, apparently on a report in The Information detailing another restructuring of its AI efforts, perhaps exacerbated by OpenAI founder Sam Altman granting that some AI investing activity is looking a bit bubbly. Ahead of the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium late this week, the Street is getting itself wound pretty tight over how Chair Jay Powell might characterize the chances of a September cut. On the one hand, circumstances are plausibly converging around one idea: In June, FOMC officials anticipated two more rate cuts by year end and there are only three more meetings. On the other hand, Powell probably has little incentive to commit firmly given high lame-duck status and the fact that more employment and inflation numbers will hit before the September meeting.

Article: A woman has sued a Florida dairy farm linked by state officials to an outbreak of infections from consuming raw milk, claiming she lost her unborn child while caring for her toddler who got sick from the milk. Rachel Maddox claimed she didn’t know about the risks involved with raw milk and her child became seriously sick after consuming the product, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Seminole County. Now she’s suing Keely Farms Dairy, a farm in New Smyrna Beach, which the Florida Department of Health earlier this month said was linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. At the time, the Florida Department of Health said it was working with the farm to ensure “effective sanitation practices are implemented consistently across every batch.” In the suit, Maddox claimed she purchased Keely Farms Dairy raw milk at Wild Hare Natural Market in June of this year when she was nearly 20 weeks pregnant. Maddox and her husband began to provide the milk to their toddler, identified by the initials L.U., but after consuming the raw milk on June 8, 2025, the lawsuit alleges L.U. They took the toddler to Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children on June 9 “for the first of what would be three emergency room visits and hospitalizations in the next several weeks,” the suit said. STEC bacteria in the most severe form can also result in hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure and is particularly concerning for children, the Florida Health Department said. On June 30, the complaint says Rachel had a lumbar puncture and was screened for the onset of Guillain Barre Syndrome — a rare condition that causes nerve damage and is most commonly caused by campylobacter infection, according to the CDC. Coli and campylobacter, and was therefore “unreasonably dangerous.” It accuses the farm of failing to properly test its products, failing to adequately monitor sanitary conditions and failing to warn the public about contamination As a result, Maddox suffered pain, suffering, mental anguish, disability, medical and pharmaceutical expenses, and lost wages as a result of the incident.

Article: A transgender distance runner is suing the NCAA and her former college, alleging they violated state and federal law by barring her from the women’s track and field team because of her gender identity. Evie Parts, who graduated from Swarthmore College in May, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday accusing the NCAA and the school of violating Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in education. For two months this year, the complaint says, Swarthmore told Parts she had to compete as part of the men’s team or run unattached to the school, meaning she could not access its services for athletes, including transportation and medical care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The ultimatum pushed Parts into a severe “depressive state” and she “in one moment told a friend that she wanted to kill herself,” the lawsuit states. Advertisement Parts’s removal from the team came after the NCAA changed its transgender athlete policy, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth — a measure most Americans generally support. The NCAA revised the policy to comport with President Donald Trump’s executive order stating that schools would be denied Title IX funding if they allowed transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports. She argues that by following rules from the NCAA — a private, nongovernmental organization — and excluding her from competing with the women’s track team, Swarthmore disregarded Title IX and Pennsylvania law, which bars discrimination based on gender identity. Her lawsuit calls the NCAA’s revision a “bigoted policy that subjected transgender women to segregation and ridicule.” In a statement Monday, Swarthmore said it worked with Parts during “a time of rapidly evolving guidance, while balancing the ability for other members of the women’s track team to compete in NCAA events.” Advertisement “We recognize that this is an especially difficult and painful time for members of the transgender community, including student-athletes,” Swarthmore said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Under Trump, schools across the country have been forced to navigate Education Department probes and new policies targeting transgender students, the facilities they use and the sports they play. Over the next few weeks, Parts competed in at least one race as an unattached athlete, paying the entry fee, driving herself there and buying her own jersey to wear because she could not wear the Swarthmore uniform, according to the complaint. During the race, the filing states, Parts wore arm sleeves with the jersey to “hide the razor marks on her arms because she did not want her teammates nor her parents to see the incisions that she inflicted on herself.” Ahead of another race in April, Parts hired an attorney to help ensure that she could run unattached, the lawsuit says.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we have the latest on President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Republicans’ redistricting plans in Texas now that a group of Democratic lawmakers have returned home. — Adam Wollner Trump and Zelenskyy signal progress as they meet with European leaders on Ukraine war By Peter Nicholas, Megan Lebowitz and Kristen Welker President Donald Trump met for about an hour at the White House today with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an accelerating effort to end the grinding war with Russia on terms acceptable to both sides. Trump greeted the Ukrainian leader in the early afternoon with a smile and warm handshake — a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office. Fresh off a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump summoned Zelenskyy to see if they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine’s future security and the status of territory that the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine. A number of European leaders joined Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House to work toward a breakthrough in the nearly three-and-a-half-year conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if allowed to persist. (At Zelenskyy’s last meeting at the White House, a reporter asked him why he wasn’t wearing a suit.) When his meeting with Trump ended, Zelenskyy said: “We had a very good conversation — maybe the best one.” What happens next is far from clear. Depending on the progress made, he said he would try to convene a meeting that hasn’t happened since the war began — a trilateral summit with himself, Putin and Zelenskyy.

Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.” Texas Democrats, without any real legislative power, won praise nationwide from members of their party for delaying the Republicans’ pursuit of a rare, mid-decade redistricting effort and raising awareness of the issue. They said their second condition to return was for California Democrats to release a plan that would seek to offset any changes Texas Republicans made to their map, which they did on Friday. takeover: Some Republicans governors announced over the weekend that they are sending their states’ National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to supplement Trump’s effort to combat crime in the nation’s capital.

Article: RAFAH, Egypt — Hamas said Monday it has accepted a new proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as Israel indicated its positions haven't changed, while Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000. Israel announced plans to reoccupy Gaza City and other heavily populated areas after ceasefire talks appeared to break down last month, raising the possibility of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which experts say is sliding into famine. proposal for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages would be released and the sides would negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest. An Egyptian official, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, said the proposal includes changes to Israel's pullback of its forces and guarantees for negotiations on a lasting ceasefire during the initial truce. Netanyahu said in a video addressing the Israeli public that reports of Hamas’ acceptance of the proposal showed that it is “under massive pressure.” Palestinian death toll surpasses 62,000 Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200, mostly civilians, in the attack that ignited the war.

Courtesy SJ Joslin When asked for comment on Joslin’s termination, a spokesperson for Yosemite National Park said the National Park Service, which oversees Yosemite, “is pursuing administrative action against multiple National Park Service employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” The spokesperson did not immediately respond to an additional question about which regulations the employees allegedly violated. Joslin, who is 35 and had been going to the park for years prior to working there, has written Yosemite climbing guidebooks and volunteered to work overtime to help issue hiking permits and manage traffic in the park. Joslin said they came up with the idea to hang the trans pride flag on El Capitan in the spring after President Donald Trump issued a variety of executive orders targeting trans people, including orders to change the federal definition of sex to exclude trans identities, restrict access to trans health care and prohibit trans women from competing in female sports. Jayce Kolinski Joslin said the flag display, which they organized with other LGBTQ climbers and advocates and participated in outside of work hours, was intended to celebrate trans people and show that everyone is welcome in the nation’s parks. The flag was up on El Capitan for about two hours when park officials told the climbers to remove it, though the climbers said at the time that they were not told that they had broken any park rules. Courtesy SJ Joslin There was no policy prohibiting the display of flags on El Capitan until the day after Joslin and their team hung the trans flag, when the National Park Service issued a new rule banning the hanging of large flags in wilderness areas. “Hanging flags has been a tradition that climbers have done on El Cap for decades, and that’s both individuals who are visiting the park, but also employees that are on their off time,” Joslin said. I’m the only one who’s been fired for it.” Joslin said two other NPS employees, including one who works in Yosemite and another who works in a different park, are under investigation for helping to display the trans flag. They plan to seek legal counsel to try to contest the decision, citing an executive order Trump issued on the first day of his presidency to protect free speech and end federal censorship. “I think that everyone as Americans should be upset about this, and it doesn’t matter who I am or what my identity is, this is a matter of free speech.”

Article: A ticket-reselling operation used a network of fake accounts to bypass Ticketmaster’s security protocols to grab hundreds of thousands of tickets to hugely popular tours for artists like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen and then re-sold them for millions, federal regulators said Monday. In total, the group is accused of buying 321,286 tickets to 3,261 live performances from June 2022 to December 2023, in bunches of 15 or more tickets to each event at a total cost of approximately $46.7 million and then reselling them for $52.4 million, netting approximately $5.7 million. That includes $1.2 million from reselling tickets in 2023 for Taylor Swift’s record-breaking “The Eras Tour.” In one instance, the suspects used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets for Swift’s March 2023 tour stop in Las Vegas, vastly exceeding Ticketmaster’s six-ticket limit, which they then sold for $120,000, the FTC alleges. The FTC says the defendants at one point printed up flyers in places like Baltimore claiming that participants could “make money doing verified van sign ups” in just “3 easy steps,” earning $5 for the account creation and $5 to $20 each time they received a Verified Fan presale code. It was subsequently forced to postpone the sale date for the general public seeking tickets to Swift’s tour “due to demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory.” In response, Swift alluded to broken “trust” with Ticketmaster, though she didn’t name it directly. “It’s really difficult for me to trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties, and excruciating for me to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse,” she wrote in an Instagram message in 2022, adding: “I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.” Springsteen said in a statement at the time that “ticket buying has gotten very confusing, not just for the fans, but for the artists also” but that most of his tickets are “totally affordable.” In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order focused on curbing exploitative ticket reselling practices that raise costs for fans. Ferguson said Trump's order made clear "that unscrupulous middlemen who harm fans and jack up prices through anticompetitive methods will hear from us.” “Today’s action puts brokers on notice that the Trump-Vance FTC will police operations that unlawfully circumvent ticket sellers’ purchase limits, ensuring that consumers have an opportunity to buy tickets at fair prices,” he said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether that suit is still active, but in July, Ticketmaster and Live Nation sued the FTC to block the investigation, saying that ticket purchases on its site did not use automated software, or bots, and did not violate the 2016 Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act. Strangely, in the latest complaint, the FTC includes a slide from an internal Ticketmaster presentation from 2018 that suggests the company was weighing the economic impact of imposing stricter purchasing caps that would curb bots but potentially hurt its finances. On a page labeled “evaluating potential actions” a data table is shown under the heading “serious negative economic impact if we move to 8 ticket limit across the board.” It also includes an email from one of the defendants in which he “owns up” to having exceeded the ticket-purchase limit for a May 2024 Bad Bunny show in Miami and offers to have the orders canceled, to which a Ticketmaster rep simply responds that “as long as the purchases were made using different accounts and cards, it’s within the guidelines.” Efforts to reach the three defendants — Taylor Kurth, Elan Rozmaryn and Yair Rozmaryn — named in the suit announced Monday were unsuccessful.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article Gilbert Dryden probably only has enough medication to get him through the end of October, his mother, Madison, figures. “This drug totally saves the lives of babies.” After a more than decade-long process to bring the drug to market, the treatment’s approval has repeatedly hit roadblocks with the Food and Drug Administration. “It’s the highest level of desperation.” On Monday, Stealth announced that it did submit its third application for approval of elamipretide — asking for an accelerated pathway under a significantly tighter timeline than what the agency initially recommended. In October 2024, an advisory committee to the FDA voted 10-6 in support of the therapy, paving the way for the agency to clear the first drug to treat Barth syndrome. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, wrote in an email that the “FDA did carefully consider the advice of the advisory committee members, including their rationale for their vote. While there is often a high rate of agreement between FDA and advisory committee recommendations,” the spokesman said, “there is not always concordance.” ‘Compelling medical need’ for approval After the advisory committee’s recommendation, the FDA’s rejection was unexpected. But the former official was quick to point out that given the advisory committee recommendation for approval, the “incredibly compelling medical need” of those living with Barth syndrome and the small sample of individuals who seemed to have benefited from the treatment, it certainly appeared that elamipretide was going to make it across the finish line. “And I think that’s led to an adverse outcome for some of these rare disease products.” The HHS spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request Monday for comment about the agency’s rejection of the drug or leadership issues. A Wall Street Journal Op-Ed recently offered a scathing evaluation of what’s happening at the FDA, questioning whether the agency and Commissioner Marty Makary’s stated goal of accelerating lifesaving drugs is matching the reality of their actions. The Journal said that there were averages of 52 annual drug approvals under the first Trump administration and 48 under President Joe Biden, but “there have been only 22 in the first seven months of this year,” projecting to just 38 for the year. “We’re going to have to watch them really closely because they’re at risk for recurrence of heart failure and rehospitalization and potentially decompensation to the point where they have to live in the hospital until they could get a heart transplant.” A transplant addresses the heart problem but doesn’t alleviate ongoing muscular and skeletal problems. “In fact, for Barth Syndrome, this elamipretide is really the only drug that we know of that works.” Carter said that there are six families in Georgia alone he’s been in contact with who have a loved one with the rare disease. After the recent FDA decision, Carter told NBC News in a statement that he’s “disappointed” with the recommendation “now that all issues appear to be resolved.” Carter said he’s continuing to put pressure on the FDA and that “patients will suffer with further delays.” He also acknowledged that the economics of a private company, like Stealth, attempting to continue developing a drug for such a small population of patients would be exceedingly difficult without FDA backing. Madison Dryden and her husband are left with what they call a “giant unknown” in the absence of approval, struggling for an explanation for their 7- and 3-year-old daughters as families are in a race against time to keep loved ones alive. “They know that somebody is not giving permission for Gilbert to have his medicine, and that they keep saying no, and they’re our kids — like they can’t lose … we can’t have them lose their baby brother to this,” she said.

Article: Last week, following the attempted carjacking of one of his staffers, Donald Trump deployed federal troops to Washington, D.C., to combat what he called an “out of control” crime wave in the city. “There’s no spike in crime that we’re experiencing in Washington, D.C., and even then, what is it exactly that the National Guard will do to quell that?” Fanone said that while there is value in federal and local forces working together to combat crime, what is unfolding in D.C. That place is not having roving bands of officers in tactical gear, aimlessly walking around.” Fanone said Trump is using federal agents to create “the optics of an occupying force” and spread “fear.” “Citizens don’t want to feel as though they’re occupied. Fanone didn’t direct his ire just at Trump, he also accused federal law enforcement agents — particularly ICE — of being complicit in the president’s overreach, calling the agency “Donald Trump’s Police Department.” Fanone said he had a simple message for “everyone in the law enforcement community that’s being co-opted by the Trump administration to do things that are immoral, unethical and, in many cases, unconstitutional: Quit your job.” “There’s a lot of other jobs out there,” Fanone said. “I quit my job at the police department, and I got to tell you, when it comes to law enforcement, the grass is always greener somewhere else.” You can watch Fanone’s full reaction in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: READ MORE: ‘Brain rot’ is Oxford’s word of the year “Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, the world’s largest online dictionary. “Skibidi” is a gibberish term coined by the creator of an animated YouTube series and can mean “cool” or “bad” or be used with no real meaning as a joke. Other planned additions include “tradwife,” a contraction of “traditional wife” referring to a married mother who cooks, cleans and posts on social media, and “delulu,” a shortening of the word delusional that means “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.” Christian Ilbury, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, said many of the new words are tied to social media platforms like TikTok because that is how most young people communicate. Cambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than 2 billion words of written and spoken English, to monitor how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used, the company said. “If you look at what a dictionary’s function is, it’s a public record of how people use language and so if people are now using words like ‘skibidi’ or ‘delulu,’ then the dictionary should take account of that,” Ilbury said.

Article: In two lawsuits filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the Tate brothers accuse TikTok and Meta of defaming and unlawfully “deplatforming” them by removing their social media accounts. The lawsuits, which are largely identical, claim the removals of their accounts were “not an isolated enforcement action grounded in neutral application of its Terms of Use, rather, it was the culmination of a coordinated campaign to suppress, silence, and destroy the reputations and livelihoods of two controversial but law-abiding men.” The brothers also allege that the “deplatforming” was done without notice or explanation and that it violated contractual agreements and stripped them of their main sources of revenue. Their brand and business model relied heavily on their social media engagement, the lawsuits say, and their removals from the platforms led to “substantial and irreplaceable financial loss and damage.” TikTok and Meta “inflicted” “substantial financial, reputational, and emotional harm,” according to the lawsuit. In May, the U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service charged both brothers with rape, human trafficking and other crimes, leading Romanian courts to issue an order to extradite them to the U.K. In 2023, they filed a defamation suit in Palm Beach County, Florida, Circuit Court against people they claim provided false evidence to Romanian authorities and conspired to deceive officials to have them wrongfully imprisoned. The Tates’ lawsuits note that while they were “arrested in Romania and placed under house arrest in connection with criminal investigations, neither was, or has been, convicted of human trafficking or sexual exploitation.” “Despite this, TikTok and other actors repeatedly invoked these allegations to justify censorship and reputational damage, again with no opportunity for Plaintiffs to question or dispel such false and malicious accusations,” the lawsuits say. Andrew Tate has previously pushed back against the criticisms of his online presence, telling NBC News in November 2022 that he is playing an “online character.” He said at the time that he makes “many videos praising women” and that his coaching involves teaching men “to avoid toxic people as a whole.” Tate said he tells his audience to avoid “low value people,” including “toxic men.” Andrew Tate wrote Sunday on X that he is shelling out money (he says “400,000,000 of personal funds”) to battle the platforms and those who tried to “cancel” him, including “mainstream media across Australia UK and USA,” as well as “every single girl who lied about me.” “It’s good vs evil and I will lose my entire fortune in this fight,” he wrote to his nearly 11 million followers. “I’m happy to go broke and live on the street trying to beat The Matrix.” The brothers seek more than $50 million in compensatory damages from each company, according to the respective lawsuits.

Link: https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/national-guard-dc-trump-republican-governors-ohio-rcna225606
Article: In one sense, the decisions of the governors of Ohio, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia to send National Guard troops from their states to aid President Donald Trump’s authoritarian takeover of Washington, D.C., should not have surprised anyone. Patrick Morrisey proclaimed such allegiance when he signed three pieces of legislation that his office said were “meant to protect the 2nd Amendment rights of West Virginians.” Morrisey said at the time: “As Governor, I will always support and defend West Virginians’ God-given constitutional rights. The bills I signed today further enshrine West Virginia’s strong support for the Second Amendment.” This is not the first time that President Trump has tested the loyalty of red-state governors in this way. But let’s compare the decisions of Morrissey, South Carolina’s Henry McMaster, Mississippi's Tate Reeves and Ohio’s Mike DeWine to deploy their states’ National Guard with the language of the Second Amendment. It reads, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Note why the militia is needed: for the “security of a free State” [emphasis added]. The governors were eager to make clear that they, as McMaster explained, stand "with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital.” Or take Morrisey, who said, “West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital.” This is not the first time that Trump has tested the loyalty of red-state governors in this way. While red states jumped to answer the president’s call, governors and Guard commanders in blue states were incredulous.” “The result,” the Post continues, “was a deployment to the nation’s capital that military historians say appears to have been without precedent: Over 98 percent of the 3,800 troops that arrived in the District came from states with Republican governors.” Five years later, the deployment of troops from Trump-loving states in the District of Columbia, where every one of Trump’s Democratic opponents has received over 90% of the vote and where Blacks make up almost 45% of the population, is no less disturbing. The drafters of the Declaration of Independence included among the British monarchy’s “repeated injuries and usurpations” the following: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures; He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power;” and kept “large bodies of armed troops among us.” That’s why people like Alexander Hamilton thought it was important that states have their own military force. “If standing armies,” he wrote, “are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions.” Hamilton hoped that militias controlled by the states would be all that would be necessary to assure peace in the new Republic and did not think that they ever would threaten liberty. Whatever their views on whether the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms, historians generally agree that one of the key purposes of the amendment was to ensure that states had the resources needed to resist encroachments on liberty perpetrated by the federal government. As Supreme Court Justice James McReynolds put it in 1939, “In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier.” Troops from Ohio, South Carolina, Mississippi and West Virginia deployed in Washington are being asked to display the character of soldiers, not that of the “neighbors” that Hamilton envisioned. Hamilton thought that there would be no danger “from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits, and interests.” Sending members of state National Guards to a place different in “feelings, sentiments, habits and interests” from the District of Columbia may please the president.

Article: Trump wants to stop states from voting by mail and using voting machines toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images President Trump announced Monday on his social media site, Truth Social, that he plans to "lead a movement" to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines in the country ahead of next year's midterm elections. "We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail in ballots because they're corrupt," Trump said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Monday. It's the only way they can get elected." Sponsor Message Although Trump himself urged his supporters to vote using mail-in ballots prior to the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have been significantly more likely to vote using mail-in ballots, compared to Republicans, since the 2020 election . "Unless the president has some theory under which he could try to ban certain kinds of voting machines or tried to ban mail in ballots by enforcing some existing federal law, he would need the cooperation of Congress," Hasen said, "which I think he'd be unlikely to get to have any kind of federal interference with how the midterm elections will be run." Sponsor Message David Becker, the executive director and founder of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the Founders deliberately gave the president no role in how elections are conducted. "Hamilton foresaw, and made clear in Federalist 59 that a democracy must diversify power of elections in order to protect itself from an overzealous executive, and therefore power over elections would reside with the several states," he told NPR in a statement. It would also be a logistical stretch to upend how states run their elections as midterm primaries get closer, said Matt Germer, director of the right-of-center R Street Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "And they need to make sure that they invest the resources in an in-person voting to maybe account for that." He said officials would have to find more locations to host polling places. "It would be a huge undertaking and I think realistically it's highly unlikely that he could end voting by mail or end the use of very particular voting machines in time for 2026 now," Germer said. Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, which advocates for wide use of mail-in voting, said it would be nearly impossible to actually get rid of mail-in voting in such a short timeframe. "This is yet another power grab of federal overreach into the states' rights to run their own election." Hasen said Trump has tried to interfere in elections before by seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost, so he said "it would not be surprising" if he were again trying to interfere with a major election. "And so now is the time to take preparations on the part of states and parts of courts and others to ensure that the elections that we conduct in 2026 will be conducted with fairness and integrity," Hasen said.

Article: The California state legislature passed a bill Monday that ensures homeowners, not lenders, receive at least some of the interest on insurance payouts for homes destroyed or damaged by natural disasters. California Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the author of the bill, said he is fighting to change that after hearing from his constituents about their struggles getting insurance payouts released from their lenders. "If the homeowners are not given their money right away, the interest on that money, which the banks and the mortgage lenders are holding onto and earning [interest on], should be paid to the homeowner, not the banks," Harabedian told CNBC. "This is a commonsense solution that ensures that [homeowners] receive every resource available to help them recover and rebuild," Newsom said in a statement in February when the bill was first introduced. "It's sad that we have to introduce a bill to make the banks and the mortgage lenders do the right thing, but this is about homeowners getting all the financial help that they can throughout this difficult period," Harabedian said.

Article: The scenes are part of a 2-minute video Kastyukevich posted on the Telegram messaging app showing Russian officials and their local allies removing young children from the Regional Children’s Home in Kherson in late October, weeks before it was liberated by Ukrainian forces. The country accuses Moscow of abducting tens of thousands of its children and shipping them to Russia with the intent of stripping them of their national identity, a crime that Ukrainian officials call a form of genocide. Russia denies allegations of war crimes, and says it has evacuated close to 2 million civilians, including hundreds of thousands of children, from what it said were dangerous areas of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials in Kherson immediately called it a “kidnapping.” Very little is known about what happened to the children, but senior Russian officials told NBC News that they are still in Crimea. On Friday, Ukraine formally charged Kastyukevich, who shared the video of the children’s evacuation, as well as an ex-worker at the orphanage and an official in the region, accusing them of the illegal transfer and deportation of the children from the facility. In an unprecedented move against the leader of a permanent United Nations Security Council member state, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and his children’s representative, Maria Lvova-Belova, in March. Prosecutors at the Hague-based war-crimes court accused them of “unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children” from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia, including “the deportation of at least hundreds of children taken from orphanages and children’s care homes.” Moscow has dismissed accusations that it illegally deports Ukrainian children, and Russian officials have touted cases where they say they rescued children from active fighting. Lvova-Belova, who has said in multiple Telegram posts that she is now the foster parent of a child from Mariupol , a city devastated by Russia’s war, has borne the brunt of international scrutiny. (Bernat Armangue / AP file) Her social media feeds are full of videos of Russian foster families greeting Ukrainian orphans, whom she has personally delivered across the country, with balloons and toys. Lvova-Belova says she visited the children from the Kherson Regional Children’s Home in a home in Crimea shortly after they were removed from Ukraine, and promised to find their relatives. (Kremlin.ru) She did not respond to a request to visit the children in Crimea, but did tell NBC News that her office was actively looking for their relatives in Ukraine. Mykola Kuleba, CEO of Save Ukraine , a leading nongovernmental organization that helps deported Ukrainian children return home, said the organization had identified the children taken from the Kherson orphanage and is looking into the case. After the ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova — in part to prevent “further commission of crimes” — Kuleba said reuniting children with families had become even more challenging. Lyudmyla Afanasieva is a former staff member of the Kherson orphanage and cared for the children while they were in the basement of a church whose pastor had sheltered them during heavy fighting. (Chris McGrath / Getty Images file) At least three senior Ukrainian officials told NBC News they were actively working on the case: the country’s chief prosecutor, its children’s representative and the human rights ombudsman. “If we are speaking about little ones who, in a year, can forget about where they are from, what their names are … it will be very difficult to return these children, but we will fight for every one of them,” Herasymchuk said. In May, nearly 15 months after Russia’s invasion, Lvova-Belova said that Kyiv had for the first time sent concrete information on 11 children whose parents were looking for them, without providing their locations or further details. “Thousands of names” had been forwarded to his counterpart in Moscow, Tatyana Moskalkova, who works closely with Lvova-Belova, he said, although he did not provide any documents or other evidence.

Article: 'No-one comes for us': The women trapped in Afghanistan's mental health system 20 minutes ago Share Save Mahjooba Nowrouzi BBC Afghan Service, in Kabul Share Save BBC BBC visited a mental health centre that is struggling to cope with the number of patients High on a hill in the west of the Afghan capital, Kabul, behind a steel gate topped with barbed wire, lies a place few locals speak of, and even fewer visit. The women's wing of a mental health centre run by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is the largest of only a handful of facilities in the country dedicated to helping women with mental illnesses. Thought to be in her mid-20s, she's been here for nine years, after enduring what she describes as abuse and neglect by her family, followed by a period of homelessness. Mariam has been in this facility for nine years Their stories are far from unique at the centre, where our visit, including conversations with staff and patients, is overseen by officials from the Taliban government. No-one comes to visit, and they end up living and dying here." Years of conflict has left its mark on the mental health of many Afghans, especially women, and the issue is often poorly understood and subject to stigma. In response to a recent UN report on the worsening situation of women's rights in Afghanistan, Hamdullah Fitrat, Taliban government's deputy spokesperson, told the BBC that their government did not allow any violence against women and they have "ensured women's rights in Afghanistan". But UN data released in 2024 points to a worsening mental health crisis linked to the Taliban's crackdown on women's rights: 68% of women surveyed reported having "bad" or "very bad" mental health. Many have no male relative to provide for them - 80% of my patients are young women with family issues." The Taliban government says it is committed to providing health services.

Article: At the meeting among President Trump, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and other European leaders on Monday in Washington, there was frequent discussion of “security guarantees” to make sure Russia does not invade again. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has talked about assembling a force, drawn from a “coalition of the willing,” that would be stationed in Ukraine after a cease-fire or peace agreement. It would be put in place only for defensive purposes, but the idea would be to deter Russia by making the Kremlin think hard about getting into a conflict with soldiers from NATO member states. It would not be able to mount much of a defense, but the theory is that the Russians would hesitate to risk killing non-Ukrainian Europeans in any resumed invasion effort.

Article: It appears to have been rekindled, or at least stoked, by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who reinforced Trump's unsubstantiated view that postal ballots "rigged" the 2020 election, at a summit Friday in Alaska. Follow live politics updates here In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier on Friday, Trump relayed that "one of the most interesting things" Putin told him during the summit had to do with the unreliability of mail-in voting. "They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do." He also brought it up when he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later in the day, saying, "Mail-in ballots are corrupt." But Trump faces high legal and political hurdles to changing the laws governing federal elections: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, the popularity of absentee balloting and the GOP's success in using mail-in votes in key swing states, such as Trump's home state, Florida. The Constitution vests the power for choosing the "times, places and manner" of House and Senate elections in state legislatures, with Congress and the president retaining the right to pass laws overriding them. "I don’t want to presuppose what might be in the executive order, but I think it’s pretty clear that the times, places and manners of elections are set by the state. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, “Senate Democrats will make sure that any and every measure that would make it even more difficult for Americans to vote will be dead on arrival in the Senate and will continue to fight to protect our democracy." The Republican National Committee hinted at the power of Congress in a statement Monday supporting Trump's plan. “Under his leadership and direction, the RNC is continuing to build upon our historic election integrity efforts from the successful 2024 election cycle, and we will be ready to help implement any and all changes made to our nation’s election laws by the President and Congress," RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said. "The Republican Election Integrity motto is simple: we want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” Beyond those challenges, many Republicans say Trump is fishing in a politically toxic pond that is better left alone. By contrast, in 2024, his advisers persuaded him to embrace those practices on the premise that he could "bank" votes early and not have to spend money trying to mobilize people who had already cast ballots. What is he talking about?’” Trump's White House recently hosted a group of secretaries of state to discuss "our ongoing commitment to election integrity," said Ben Kindel, a spokesperson for Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican. … Changes to Ohio's voting process require a vote of the General Assembly, so I'm sure we'll be talking with them as well." Trump's aversion to absentee ballots is perhaps most striking because Republicans' recent success in Florida elections — in Trump's home state — has coincided with the state GOP's mastery of mail-in voting. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has been a longtime proponent of early voting in the state and helped Trump see the benefit to him across swing states in 2024. But his message, that the practice is inherently corrupt, has altered the landscape in Florida, allowing Democrats to ramp up their efforts and, for the first time, take an edge in vote-by-mail ballots — even as Trump won the state in 2020 and 2024. “For years, you had to build into turnout plans the fact that the GOP would have a big advantage in vote by mail,” Steve Schale, a longtime Florida Democratic operative who was an early advocate of his party’s better using mail ballots, said in a message to NBC News. “There was a time when Republicans owned and relied on voting by mail,” said longtime Republican operative Mac Stipanovich, who helped build Florida’s vote-by-mail program but left the GOP over disagreements with Trump. Bob Martinez, said the idea of expanding vote-by-mail to make it easier for all voters to cast ballots is “anathema to the Trump Republican Party, in which voter suppression is dressed up as preventing voter fraud.” Florida Gov. “Our theory is if they had the luxury of checking a box in that general election return ballot that said, ‘Please keep my vote by mail request valid,’ then we could have continued to send them their vote-by-mail ballot for the special election.” Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, a DeSantis appointee and Trump supporter, did not reply to a request for comment about Trump’s renewed push to crack down on voting by mail. We will challenge any unlawful executive order and will beat this unconstitutional attempt to disenfranchise millions of Americans." Oregon conducts its elections entirely by mail, and it was the first state to hold a presidential election by mail. If he had any inclination to actually understand or care about the American people, he'd know that mail-in voting is really the best way to protect everybody's right to vote, and that's especially true for rural folks, for elderly people and for people who work for an hourly wage." Read also pointed to the states' constitutional role in deciding how to conduct elections, adding, "I'm going to protect the rights of Oregonians and the rights of the state to choose how we elect our representatives. This is a real threat." Some Trump allies say no one should be surprised by his desire to stop mail-in balloting, as he has long decried the practice of voting in any way other than in person on Election Day.

Article: Rebels backed by ISIL (ISIS) have killed at least 52 civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this month, according to the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) in the country, as both the DRC army and Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group accuse each other of violating a recently reached US-mediated ceasefire deal. Attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) targeted the Beni and Lubero territories of the eastern North Kivu province between August 9 and 16, MONUSCO said on Monday, warning that the death toll could rise further. The renewed violence comes as a separate conflict between the DRC army and the M23 group continues to simmer in the east of the country, despite a series of peace treaties signed in recent months. The latest ADF “violence was accompanied by kidnappings, looting, the burning of houses, vehicles, and motorcycles, as well as the destruction of property belonging to populations already facing a precarious humanitarian situation,” MONUSCO said. “When they arrived, they first woke the residents, gathered them in one place, tied them up with ropes, and then began to massacre them with machetes and hoes,” Macaire Sivikunula, chief of Lubero’s Bapere sector, told the Reuters news agency over the weekend. Advertisement After a relative lull in recent months, authorities said the group killed nearly 40 people in Komanda city, Ituri province, last month, when it stormed a Catholic church during a vigil and fired on worshippers, including many women and children. The ADF, an armed group formed by former Ugandan rebels in the 1990s after discontent with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, has killed thousands of civilians and increased looting and killings in the northeastern DRC. Among the 52 victims so far this month, at least nine were killed overnight from Saturday to Sunday in an attack on the town of Oicha, in North Kivu, the AFP news agency learned from security and local sources. A few days earlier, the ADF had already killed at least 40 people in several towns in the Bapere sector, also in North Kivu province, according to local and security sources.

Article: WATCH: Trump promises ‘lasting peace’ in Zelenskyy meeting, says Ukraine peacekeeping force under consideration “And do you know that we’re the only country in the world — I believe, I may be wrong — but just about the only country in the world that uses (mail-in voting) because of what’s happened, massive fraud all over the place,” Trump said. 18 White House remarks that his administration is preparing an executive order “to end mail-in ballots because they’re corrupt.” We asked the White House for evidence to support Trump’s statement about other countries and received no response to that question. Data compiled by a Sweden-based organization that advocates for democracy globally found in an October 2024 report found that 34 countries or territories allow mail-in voting, which it refers to as “postal voting.” Dozens of countries allow at least some mail-in voting The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found that of the 34 countries or territories, 12 allow all voters to vote by mail and in 22 permit only some voters to vote this way. All Canadians are eligible to use mail-in voting, said York University associate professor Cary Wu, who co-wrote a 2024 paper about the effect of Trump’s anti-mail voting messaging on Canadians’ views of mail voting. In the United Kingdom, on-demand postal voting in Britain was part of a wider modernization in electoral administration in the early 2000s, according to a 2021 paper by United Kingdom researchers. States set mail-in voting laws In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that “the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the president tells them. UCLA election law professor Rick Hasen wrote on his blog that Trump’s statement is “wrong and dangerous.” “The Constitution does not give the President any control over federal elections,” Hasen wrote, adding that federal courts have recognized those limits. READ MORE: Trump changes tone on mail-in ballots and other forms of early voting The Constitution’s Article 1, Section 4 says that the regulation of elections is the power of the states. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields did not address that question but said Trump wants to require voter ID and prevent “cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.” There is no evidence of widespread cheating in California and New York, two of the most populous states that consistently elect Democrats for president.

Article: In mid-July, the State Board of Elections began formally an effort that seeks to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s Justice Department that focused on voter registration records that lacked either a voter's driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Federal and state laws have directed that election officials request this ID information since 2004, but for about a decade the state’s registration form failed to make clear that voters were supposed to provide it if they had it. A ” Registration Repair Project” supported by the now Republican-controlled state board — flipped from a Democratic majority in the spring — created a public online database with the names of 103,270 registrants the lacking the numerical identifiers. As planned, the board is now sending letters to those who haven't already acted and offered a numerical ID, or have yet to indicate that they have neither a driver's license nor a Social Security number. It’s free,” board Executive Director Sam Hayes said, adding that taking action now will "avoid any issues the next time they show up to vote.” People on the list who don't provide the information will have to vote provisionally the next time they cast a ballot — meaning their ballots may not count in some state and local races without correct ID information. Another mailing will go out at a later date to close to 100,000 additional voters whose records also lack the identifiers but will be allowed to continue casting regular ballots because there’s evidence, for example, that they supplied a number or an alternate ID as allowed under the law.

Article: A drug dealer dubbed the “Ketamine Queen” has agreed to plead guilty to five federal criminal charges, including that she provided the drug that ultimately led actor Matthew Perry to suffer a fatal overdose in October 2023, federal prosecutors announced Monday. Sangha supplied the ketamine the “Friends” actor injected on the day of his death, according to the plea agreement, which also noted that she sold drugs for years out of her North Hollywood apartment, described in a federal indictment as the “Sangha stash house.” As part of a deal struck with federal prosecutors, Sangha admitted to knowingly distributing ketamine to Perry, whose struggles with drug addiction and numerous rehab visits were well documented. Perry, who had become addicted to intravenous ketamine, started purchasing the powerful drug from a Southern California doctor in late September 2023, according to the indictment and law enforcement officials. Shortly after the Los Angeles Times and TMZ published news of Perry’s death, according to the plea agreement, Sangha called Fleming on the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss how to distance themselves from it. Does K stay in your system or is it immediately flushed out[?].” Sangha, who has been in custody for the past year, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison on the drug-involved premises count, up to 10 years for each ketamine distribution count and up to 15 years for the count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury. As part of the formal guilty plea in the coming weeks, she will also admit to using her North Hollywood residence to store, package, and distribute narcotics since at least June 2019.

Article: Idaho murders: New details reveal what surviving roommate saw and heard in the house A photo posted by Kaylee Goncalves shows University of Idaho students Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Goncalves. When investigators were working to solve the University of Idaho quadruple murders, what at first appeared to be an early lead to help gauge the killer's familiarity with the victims quickly evaporated as the only surviving witness started to remember more details from that night. 13, 2022 she "was awoken and opened her room door" and "heard a male say 'it's ok Kaylee, I'm here for you,'" referring to one of the victims, 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves, according to newly released documents. "She has been working through it to try to remember what happened." Defense attorney Anne Taylor repeatedly questioned Mortensen's credibility as a witness, saying she "had too much to drink and couldn't remember" and "said things that were just absolutely untrue and couldn't have been true." Prosecutors pushed back, saying while versions of Mortensen's story varied, she was consistent enough, and the judge ultimately sided with prosecutors. The newly-released documents revealed that Mortensen said she heard who she thought was Goncalves walking upstairs toward her third floor room and "heard Kaylee say 'someone's here,' and she sounded frantic," according to the police interview. Mortensen "believed it was Kaylee who was walking up the stairs with [her dog] Murphy," then "heard who she believed to be Kaylee running down the stairs," the interview said. Mortensen said Murphy -- who didn't usually bark -- "was barking at this time." Four University of Idaho students were found dead at an off-campus home on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, in November 2022. "She then heard a male voice, which she stated she had never heard before, say 'It's okay, I'm going to help you.'" She said the male voice was not victim Ethan Chapin, who was asleep in his girlfriend Xana Kernodle's second-floor bedroom at the time. Kernodle -- who investigators say may have interrupted admitted killer Bryan Kohberger on the third floor -- was then attacked near her second-floor bedroom, suffering over 50 stab wounds, a police report said. "She described the suspect as not being muscular, but being skinny and toned, like a basketball player." "She looked down the hallway to Xana's bedroom and could see Xana lying on her back in her underwear, but she thought at the time Xana was passed out," according to the interview. "She said there were people coming in and out of their house all the time." Dylan Mortensen gets a hug after speaking at the sentencing hearing of Bryan Kohberger after he was convicted in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, at the Ada County Courthouse, in Boise, Idaho, July 23, 2025. Moscow police lead detective Brett Payne tracked the time, and a state police detective "walked through the residence with me calling out the number of strikes to simulate the number of wounds to each victim, based on autopsy reports," Gilbertson wrote. Gilbertson said he "conducted two timed runs, the first being a quick as possible run and the second a slower, deliberate timed run" during which he was quiet and more "methodical." Bryan Kohberger, 30, appears for his sentencing hearing after he was convicted in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, at the Ada County Courthouse, in Boise, Idaho, July 23, 2025. "The timed runs revealed that it was possible for Kohberger to have carried out the murders in as few as two minutes and six seconds, going at a fast pace on the shortest route to the vehicle, or as much as three minutes and forty-five seconds, going at a slower pace on the longer route to the vehicle," the report said. Photos of the crime scene released with the documents show a home common for college Greek life: counters littered with empty hard seltzer cans, wine bottles, snack wrappers and sticks of gum. Kaylee Goncalves/Instagram Goncalves had "jokingly mentioned she thought she had" a "stalker" after someone followed her to her car at the grocery store "a couple months" before the murders, one of the victims' neighbors said, according to the documents. The 22-year-old, who had graduated six months before the murders, described the house "as an 'open door policy,' meaning people were constantly going in and out," according to her interview with police. "Only their close friends would use the sliding glass door in the kitchen." Investigators believe Kohberger used that sliding glass door to slip into the home and fatally stab Goncalves, Mogen, Kernodle and Chapin.

Article: California Democrats on Monday kicked off the process to redraw the state’s congressional districts, an extraordinary action they said was necessary to neutralize efforts by President Trump and Texas Republicans to increase the number of GOP lawmakers in Congress. Gavin Newsom that California must respond to Trump’s efforts to “rig” the 2026 midterms by working to reduced by half the number of Republicans in the state’s 52-member congressional delegation. “But with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight, and when the dust settles on election day, we will win.” Republicans accused Democrats of trying to subvert the will of the voters, who passed independent redistricting 15 years ago, for their own partisan goals. “The citizens seized back control of the power from the politicians in 2010,” said Assemblymember Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego), flanked by GOP legislators and signs in the Capitol rotunda that said, “Rigged map” and “Defend fair elections.” Advertisement “Let me be very clear,” DeMaio said. to seize back control.” After Trump urged Texas to redraw its congressional districts to add five new GOP members to Congress, Newsom and California Democrats began calling to temporarily reconfigure the current congressional district boundaries, which were drawn by the voter-approved independent redistricting commission in 2021. Advertisement Newsom, other Democratic lawmakers and labor leaders launched a campaign supporting the redrawing of California’s congressional districts on Thursday, and proposed maps were sent to state legislative leaders on Friday. The measures that lawmakers will take up this week would: Give Californians the power to amend the state Constitution and approve new maps, drawn by Democrats, that would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 congressional elections, if any GOP-led states approve their own maps. “We firmly believe that they should cool it, pull back, because if they do, so will California.” Republicans responded by calling for a federal investigation into the California Democratic redistricting plan, and vowed to file multiple lawsuits in state and federal court, including two this week. “We’re going to litigate this every step of the way, but we believe that this will also be rejected at the ballot box, in the court of public opinion,” DeMaio said. He also called for a 10-year ban on holding elected office for state legislators who vote in support of calling the special election, although he did not say how he would try to do that. Advertisement McGuire dismissed the criticism and threats of legal action, saying the Republicans were more concerned about political self-preservation than the will of California voters or the rule of law.

Article: WATCH: Trump promises ‘lasting peace’ in Zelenskyy meeting, says Ukraine peacekeeping force under consideration The talks, which included a second meeting with seven European and NATO leaders, took place three days after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. Since meeting with Putin, Trump has talked about reaching a peace deal saying he no longer thinks Ukraine “needs a ceasefire” and noting that there needs to be concessions on both sides. Following a social media post earlier in the day in which Trump called for getting rid of mail-in voting — a voting practice he had embraced — Trump called mail-in ballots “corrupt” and “a fraud” and promised to end mail-in voting. Trump had a hand in deals that have recently eased conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand; Israel and Iran; and India and Pakistan, although some of those countries’ leaders dispute his role. As Trump spoke about how difficult it’s been to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said that, “with all of the wars that I got involved in, we only have this one left.” But his comment notably ignores Israel’s nearly two-year war with Hamas in Gaza that started on Oct. Trump weighed in on Truth Social, saying that “we will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!” $350 billion for Ukraine doesn’t add up. A White House spokesperson told PolitiFact that Trump’s figure included direct funding to Ukraine and indirect economic costs, such as war-related inflation, rising fertilizer costs and lost trade because of sanctions on Russia. Trump’s election “joke.” After a reporter asked if Zelenskyy was open to holding an election — something Trump had criticized him for not doing — he said he would be open to it once the war is over.

Article: Although the term “neoconservative” has fallen into disuse — except as an occasional slur used by the MAGA right, the progressive left and social-media antisemites who really mean to say “Jew” — I’ve never been shy about describing myself as one. Neoconservatism emerged in the early 1970s as a loosely coherent movement of disenchanted liberals who were critical of the welfare state and turned off by the anti-Americanism of parts of the antiwar left. But the movement also took a dim view of the Nixon administration, particularly in its pursuit of arms control with the Soviet Union, its relative indifference to human rights issues behind the Iron Curtain, and its realpolitik approach to foreign policy in general. I learned this the hard way 14 years ago, when Henry Kissinger nearly kicked me out of his Park Avenue office for having the ill grace to ask him about China’s brutal treatment of Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned dissident. Like President Richard Nixon’s, Trump’s politics are a mix of statist economic impulses, populist grievances, the conceit of being above the law and a transactional approach to foreign policy that discounts the moral force of American ideals.

Article: His extraordinary effort to take over law enforcement in Washington, D.C., which is ramping up as it enters its second week, helps nudge the political discourse toward what he has long seen as more favorable terrain: A fight with Democrats over crime. (And they are determined not to take the bait.) It wasn’t so long ago that Trump was praising the nationwide drop in the murder rate — or even that one of his own officials in Washington was specifically touting the drop in violent crime there. By deploying National Guard troops to patrol the streets and seeking control of the local police, his opponents say, Trump is transparently stoking fear for political gain, and exaggerating statistics to justify a power grab. Republicans seized on the pandemic crime spike to win control of the House in 2022 and to help expand Trump’s coalition in 2024, even though rates of violent crime had, by then, begun to recede.

It was the Brazilian's first Premier League double since scoring two against former side Everton in February 2024, while he's the first Spurs player to score two on opening day since Harry Kane in 2019-20 - a season Kane ended with 18 Premier League goals. Just eight more doubles to go… Tijjani Reijnders It was an incredibly impressive debut for midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, who became the first player to score and assist on his Premier League debut while playing for Manchester City since Sergio Aguero in August 2011. Only Erling Haaland had both more shots and more touches in the opposition box against Wolves than Reijnders (3 shots, 5 touches in box), while only Nico Gonzalez made more successful final third passes than the Dutchman (20). Virgil van Dijk Reigning champions Liverpool got their season off to a winning start against Bournemouth and - in a game they scored four goals - their standout player was captain Virgil van Dijk.

Article: "We are demanding that this administration do what they say they're going to do if they're not going to close the camps," Marisa Limon Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, told El Paso ABC affiliate KVIA. "At a minimum, we need access to people who have due process and should have access to attorneys." The criticism came as a federal judge on Monday heard arguments from lawyers for detainees at the Florida detention center known as "Alligator Alcatraz," who say they lack proper attorney access and are being held without any formal criminal or immigration charges against them. Veronica Escobar, who toured the new Texas detention center Monday, said of the facility's price tag, "I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans." "There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration," she said. They have no legal right to be here." "Under President Trump's leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens," Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday. "The One Big Beautiful Bill has provided historic funding to help us carry out this mandate, especially by securing enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 illegal aliens and 80,000 new ICE beds." "The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals," McLaughlin said.

"Our entire city stands with them and is here to support them." Islam, 36, was working in the lobby of the 44-story building on Park Avenue in New York City on July 28 when, police say, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas walked in and immediately opened fire using a semiautomatic rifle. Tisch said afterward that Islam was working in the lobby of the building with the department's permission under a program that allows officers to provide security off-duty but in uniform. After the attack Adams said that those who knew the officer said he “believed in living out the life of a godly person.” Tamura also shot a security guard and two civilians in the building before fatally shooting himself, authorities said. Adams said Tamura, who completed a cross-country drive just prior to the attack, was trying to target the headquarters of the NFL, which has offices in the Park Avenue building, but entered the wrong set of elevator banks and never made it to the league's offices. Two officials familiar with the matter told NBC News that the shooter, who played football in high school in Southern California, left a note at the scene that said he wanted his brain studied for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. Patrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said after the attack: “He went out every single day to provide for his family, whether it was overtime or whatever he had to do." Tisch said in her statement Monday that the newborn, his mother and his brothers are part of the NYPD fabric.

Article: Geoff Bennett: Leaders from across Europe descended on Washington today in a remarkable show of support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who came to the White House to meet President Trump. Nick Schifrin: In a deal outlined today, Ukraine’s ability to guarantee its security will rely on European troops sent into Ukraine, as well as European weapons and Europe’s purchasing American weapons to be dispatched to Ukraine. Nick Schifrin: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got by with more than a little help from those friends today, the largest ever gathering of Europeans in Washington outside a NATO summit. Vladimir Putin, Russian President (through translator): We’re convinced, in order to make the settlement extremely lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict. Nick Schifrin: Of course, the European officials who are still meeting with President Trump in the White House behind me believe that the root cause of the war is Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tonight, Vladimir Putin’s top foreign policy aide has confirmed that President Trump called Vladimir Putin in a call that was described as — quote — “frank and constructive.” A senior Ukrainian official participating in the meetings tonight tells me that the Oval Office meeting was — quote — “very good” and the whole day has gone — quote — “more than good,” indicating, Geoff, that at least the Ukrainians, or from their perspective, they have achieved what they sought to achieve today. But they had European unity on their side, including many European leaders whom President Trump has grown quite fond of, and they had momentum already on a key point, security guarantees. officials tell me that Zelenskyy wasn’t expected to say yes tonight, but they expected him not to say no, and to go back to Kyiv and perhaps present a counteroffer. Nick Schifrin: According to Russian media, just out in the last few minutes, they did discuss that trilateral meeting that President Trump has promised and that President Zelenskyy, you heard in the White House today, endorse. They argue that that summit moved the ball along, allowed this meeting today, allowed the phone call between President Trump and President Putin tonight, and that at that summit Putin agreed that these security guarantees could be offered by the United States to Ukraine. And Europe wants to keep pressure on Russia, and, as you heard Rubio and others, senior officials, saying they will not impose more sanctions while these negotiations continue — Geoff.

Article: McALLEN, Texas -- A federal judge ruled Friday to deny the Trump administration's request to end a policy in place for nearly three decades that is meant to protect immigrant children in federal custody. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone," Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement. In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.” Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.

(Chris Granger/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP, File) NEW ORLEANS -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard. Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as “personal and intimate.” The first female mayor in New Orleans’ 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment: The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working. Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was “where it all started.” Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail “due to COVID,” saying her travel accommodations were “a matter of safety, not of luxury.” The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha’s Vineyard. The pair used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, “and ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,” he said. She is also among more than 100 people brought up on corruption charges in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans two decades ago, said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a watchdog group that provided photographs and information to federal authorities in the latest case.

So if a trans person is in between transitioning, very often they will be asked not to come to synagogue.” She said even after someone has fully transitioned, rabbis should allow them to sit where they feel comfortable. “Without Eshel, I don’t know how this would have turned out for any of us.” Mann defines herself as modern Orthodox, meaning she strives to uphold Judaic law while embracing the values within her family. “Because a life is more important than all of the rules.” Respecting her daughter’s identity felt akin to saving her life, so Mann didn’t feel the need to talk to God about it. “The strength, the love and the grace to parent a child who’s walking a difficult path.” Mann feels lucky to have found support, both in religious spaces and among family members, which has helped Ellie be her joyful self again. “He’s probably my child that has the strongest commitment to Judaism from an emotional connection." A rabbi told Paneth that Ollie is welcome to come to services, but he would now be expected to sit among the men. “If I was going to survive this, I had to come out with my parents as trans and start medically transitioning.” He had top surgery in 2022 and soon after met his girlfriend at JQY, a program for Jewish LGBTQ+ teens. “Even though I look different, my relationship to God didn’t change.” Kabakov said many LGBTQ+ Jews eventually decide to leave Orthodoxy, but for those who wish to remain, Eshel and some spiritual leaders offer support. Rabbi Mike Moskowitz, who works at an LGBTQ+ synagogue in New York, thinks of his job as helping people understand how they can be their authentic selves and still feel accepted by their religion. “Orthodoxy, the people, are the problem.” The counseling he provides for trans children and their parents is specific to each person, but in general, he offers fresh interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. “Unity is coping through kindness and being able to replace the weight of oppression with the elevation of love.” ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Article: Authorities in Greece have intercepted more than 120 migrants off the island of Crete ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities in Greece say more than 120 migrants were intercepted off the island of Crete early Monday, the latest in a series of arrivals despite a suspension of asylum claims and plans for tougher detention rules. Greece’s conservative government last month suspended all asylum claims for migrants arriving by sea from North Africa, a move it argued helped deter crossings that peaked in July at more than 2,500 in a single week. It is preparing draft legislation, to be submitted after the summer recess, that would mandate imprisonment for migrants whose asylum claims are denied and require ankle monitors during a 30-day compliance period before deportation.

Article: welcoming Russian President Vladimir Putin with a red carpet in Alaska KYIV, Ukraine -- In Kyiv, Ukrainians living under near daily Russian bombardment watched with astonishment as their country’s most important ally rolled out a red carpet in Alaska for the man they blame for over three years of war, bloodshed and loss. The red carpet treatment, the lack of concrete decisions for Ukraine and, most significantly, neglecting the significance of sanctions — a policy that could turn the tide in Kyiv’s favor — have felt like a betrayal for Ukrainians who have borne enormous suffering in the almost three-and-a-half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian servicemen, the country’s bravest and most skilled, have been killed and wounded, thousands of civilians have been killed in Russian strikes, and a fifth of the country is under occupation, severing families, properties and Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It was the first time in a decade that Putin had stepped foot in the U.S., ending international isolation spurred by the 2022 Ukraine invasion; in other words, it was a win.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic) BELGRADE, Serbia -- Angry protesters clashed with police in a town in western Serbia and in the capital Belgrade on Saturday as tensions soared further in the Balkan nation following days of violent demonstrations. Wearing scarves over their faces and chanting slogans against President Aleksandar Vucic, a group of young men threw flares at his Serbian Progressive Party offices in Valjevo, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital Belgrade. Similar clashes also erupted on Saturday evening in the northern city of Novi Sad and in Belgrade, with police directing tear gas at protesters while battling the protesters who set garbage containers on fire. The protest in Valjevo drew several thousand people after a video on social media showed a young man from the town being severely beaten by police who kicked him and bashed him with batons during a protest earlier this week. Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, has called for “calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly” “Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards,” he said on X this week.

Article: Pope Leo XIV is marking his first 100 days in office, showing a mix of continuity with and change from Pope Francis' papacy VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the “salt of the Earth, the light of the world.” He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go. As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. “Even those who really loved Pope Francis always kind of held their breath a little bit: You didn’t know what was going to come out next or what he was going to do,” Hughes said. Leo has certainly gone out of his way in his first 100 days to try to heal divisions that deepened during Francis’ pontificate, offering messages of unity and avoiding controversy at almost every turn. He has furthered that legacy by giving the go-ahead for the Vatican to turn a 430-hectare (1,000-acre) field north of Rome into a vast solar farm that should generate enough electricity to meet Vatican City’s needs and turn it into the world’s first carbon-neutral state. He has fine-tuned financial transparency regulations that Francis initiated, tweaked some other decrees to give them consistency and logic, and confirmed Francis in deciding to declare one of the 19th century’s most influential saints, John Henry Newman, a “doctor” of the church. Compared to President Donald Trump, the other American world leader who took office in 2025 with a flurry of Sharpie-penned executive decrees, Leo has eased into his new job slowly, deliberately and quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to himself. Maria Isabel Ibarcena Cuarite, a Peruvian member of a Catholic charismatic group, said it was precisely Leo’s quiet emphasis on church traditions, its sacraments and love of Christ, that drew her and upward of 1 million young people to Rome for a special Jubilee week this month. Peter's a few times since his election, and some wonder if he will invite some brothers to live with him in the Apostolic Palace to recreate the spirit of Augustinian community life there. Given Francis’ stump speech before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, the then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio essentially described Prevost in identifying the church's mission today: He said the church was "called to go outside of itself and go to the peripheries, not just geographic but also the existential peripheries.” Prevost, who hails from Chicago, spent his adult life as a missionary in Peru, eventually becoming bishop of Chiclayo. “He is the incarnation of the ‘unity of difference,’ because he comes from the center, but he lives in the peripheries,” said Emilce Cuda, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Prevost has recounted that at one point when he was the Augustinian superior, the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires expressed interest in assigning an Augustinian priest to a specific job in his archdiocese. “And I, as prior general, said ‘I understand, Your Eminence, but he’s got to do something else’ and so I transferred him somewhere else,” Prevost told parishioners in his home state of Illinois in 2024.

Article: Nigeria's national security adviser has announced the arrest of two militant leaders on the country's most wanted list Nigeria says it has arrested 2 militant leaders on its most wanted list LAGOS, Nigeria -- The leaders of two militant groups on Nigeria 's most wanted list have been arrested in an operation involving multiple agencies, the West African country's national security adviser said Saturday. Officials said the arrests came in an operation conducted between May and July and that they recovered valuable materials including digital evidence that is undergoing forensic analysis and could lead to more arrests. He said the arrested leaders are responsible for the Kuje prison attack in 2022 that led to the escape of dozens of jailed Boko Haram members and an attack on the Niger uranium facility in 2013, among others. Ribadu said they maintain “active links with terrorist groups across the Maghreb, particularly in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.” Nigeria faces a complex, multidimensional security challenge with various armed groups operating across the country. Oluwole Ojewale, a Dakar-based security analyst at the Institute of Security Studies, says the significant arrest will test the resilience of Ansaru and its capacity to spring surprises or mount major attacks in the immediate term.

Article: Of the 92% S & P 500 companies that have reported, 60% have beaten consensus earnings per share forecasts by more than a standard deviation of analyst estimates, according to data from the firm. "With the 2Q 2025 earnings season nearly complete, the quarter has been marked by one of the greatest frequency of earnings beats on record," wrote David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. He also said that profit margins for the S & P 500 have been "more resilient to tariffs than investors feared." "While we expect companies will generally be able to mitigate tariff costs and maintain their profit margins, the magnitude of margin expansion embedded in consensus estimates appears unrealistic," he continued. "We expect the strong recent trajectory of analyst earnings revisions to weaken going forward, but no more than the average downward trend of the last few decades." This might be a double-edged sword, however, as this strong season has led to a ratcheting up of earnings per share forecasts for the future. To be sure, Kostin said that analysts still foresee a deceleration in S & P 500 earnings per share growth in the months ahead, dropping to 7% in the second half from 11% in the second quarter.

These include buildings in Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården such as the so-called yellow row of three old wooden houses and the former home of mining manager Hjalmar Lundbohm, which was split into three parts. People have to move before the infrastructure fails." The iron ore mine's operator, LKAB - also Kiruna's biggest employer - is covering the city's relocation bill, estimated at more than 10bn Swedish krona ($1bn; £737m). "We've widened it to 24 metres (79ft) and along the way we removed lampposts, traffic lights as well as a bridge that was slated for demolition anyway." Among the most delicate aspects of the move is the protection of the church's interior treasures, especially its great altar painting made by Prince Eugen, a member of Sweden's royal family. So will the organ with its 1,000 pipes."

"The move has brought back memories of joy and sorrow to us, and we're now moving those memories with us into the future." That feeling is also shared by project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, an engineer who doubles as a member of the church's gospel choir.

That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling - affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. Elisenda Balleste The core of mud is carefully removed from the drill and kept intact for analysis A history of ocean life Researchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. This is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting. Victoria Gill/BBC The Antarctic is a feeding ground for whales and other marine life Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. It is part of a mission - the Convex Seascape Survey - which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. "Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time," she said. Elisenda Balleste Scientists carefully slice the sediment cores in a lab on board the ship The DNA fingerprint from whale hunting The newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes.

Article: Why India tops the list of abandoned sailors 41 minutes ago Share Save Neyaz Farooquee BBC News, Delhi Share Save BBC An Indian crew member of Anka cargo vessel, which is abandoned at an Ukrainian port since April Manas Kumar* has been abandoned on a cargo ship in Ukrainian waters since April. The Indian seaman was part of a crew of 14 transporting popcorn to Turkey from Moldova when the vessel was raided on 18 April, as it made its way down the Danube river which divides Ukraine and Romania. But exactly who owns the ship is not clear from the papers provided by the crew, made up of Mr Kumar, five other Indian nationals, as well as two Azerbaijanis and six Egyptians. The problem is disembarking means the crew losing their salaries - amounting to $102,828 by June all together, according to a joint database of abandoned ships maintained by International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO). But it also tops the list of crew members known as "abandoned seafarers" - a term used by 2006 Maritime Labour Convention to describe the situation when shipowners sever ties with the crew and fail to provide them for repatriation, regular provisions and wages. According to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers globally, there were 3,133 abandoned sailors across 312 ships in 2024 - of which Indian nationals accounted for 899. For many, leaving the ship without a salary is not possible - especially if they have already paid hefty sums to agents for landing the job or for acquiring training certifications, Mohammad Gulam Ansari, a former seafarer who helps repatriate Indian crew from other parts of the world, tells the BBC. Crew members of Nirvana vessel cooking food on the ship The most significant reason for abandonment is the widespread practice of registering ships - called flags of convenience - in countries that have weak shipping rules, according to ITF. "A country can set up a ship registry and charge fees to shipowners, while having reduced standards for crew safety and welfare and often failing to live up to the responsibilities of a genuine flag state," the ITF website states. BBC/ITF Crew members of Nirvana vessel were repatriated after months at the sea but continue to wait for their salaries Seafarers often blame India's maritime regulator, Directorate General (DG) of Shipping - which is tasked with verifying the credentials of ships, their owners and recruitment and placement agencies - for lax scrutiny of stakeholders. "When you are hired, you get enough time to inform the DG Shipping [about any discrepancies in your contract]," said Sushil Deorukhkar, an ITF representative working for the welfare of the seafarers. "Once you sign the papers, you are stuck and have to knock on every door for resolution." Things can get complicated even for the crew on Indian-owned ships operating within the country's waters for a variety of reasons. In early April, Mr Singh was taking it to a port in western India's Gujarat state for dismantling when an Indian court ordered its seizure "for non-payment of crew", according to the ILO-IMO database.

Article: toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR "Everybody looks and waits for this first weekend [of August] to come to Langford," says Richard Love, one of the officials at the 79th annual competition this year. "It's grassroots, it's motorsports — this place is unbelievable." Tractor pulling was created in the 1920s by farmers wanting to show off their machines and have something to look forward to, says Love. This event in Langford has been held annually since 1946, even hosting limited runs during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain its position as the longest-running event of its kind in the country. Sponsor Message Rules of the Road In the competition, tractors and trucks latch onto a contraption called a sled, which looks like a flat-bed trailer carrying a huge weighted box on a slider. Horsepower meets tradition "The crowd is just electric here – I mean, these people come to see tractor and truck pulling and they just love it here," says Kelly Giltinan, the driver behind the wheel of a red pulling truck called "Bull Headed," fit with a 1955 chassis and a chrome-plated modern engine. Sponsor Message Giltinan, who came from Pennsylvania, says that driving in a pull is a bit different from driving on the road because his truck only runs in one gear, and its engine is specially designed to produce as much power as possible in as little time as possible. "I mean, this horsepower you can feel in your chest." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR Giltinan's trip to Langford didn't go as he'd hoped — the pulling sled heavily damaged the back of his truck on his first attempt, which prevented him from making any more runs at Langford. "It's in your blood, you just love making horsepower." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR Like NASCAR, but for tractors and trucks While drivers like Giltinan get all the glory, each competitor typically has a whole team of people supporting them behind the scenes. "The team behind building them is just as important as a driver," Meals explained, "If you don't have a good driver, you can have the biggest motor you want, but it's still going to fall short." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR One local, 20-year-old Matt Sweet, said that he's been coming every year since he was born, and his father has been attending since 1975. Sponsor Message "The little kids love it – they run down the side of the track, chasing the tractors and in the pits, [and] the drivers will let them sit in the seats," says Sweet, reminded of when he was in those kid's position, "it's very nostalgic, seeing that, I just really get a full circle moment."

Article: North Korea has long denounced the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program. While inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies’ joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency said. “The security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The government of South Korea’s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who has expressed a willingness to repair ties and resume dialogue with the North, did not immediately respond to Kim’s comments. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks. Kim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. The North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure “criminal.” The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship’s weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy’s modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks. The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front line military activities and propaganda campaigns.

Article: An explosion rocked a cargo ship carrying coal in Baltimore, causing a fire and sending a stream of smoke into the sky but leaving no injuries, authorities said Monday evening. Coast Guard crews and firefighters from the city of Baltimore were among those who responded to the incident, and the fire was extinguished on the still-moving vessel, Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Matthew West said. In a statement, the Baltimore City Fire Department described the location as being in the "Patapsco River near the former Key Bridge site." It said 23 people were on board the 751 "bulk carrier" and none reported injury.

Article: So that stranger — whom authorities later identified as Bradford James Gille — began slashing him, slicing an artery in his right arm and stabbing him in the back, Boudot recalled. Grand Traverse County Sheriff's Office Boudot recalled his near-death experience as NBC News obtained security video from inside the Traverse City Walmart that shows a man believed to be the attacker running through the store with a large green bag strapped to his back. He is being held at a psychiatric facility with bond set at $1 million, and he is scheduled to appear at a hearing Friday to determine whether he’ competent to stand trial. Boudot, who works for a mortgage company, said his family had gone to the Walmart to get sidewalk chalk — he and his wife have four children — when a store employee said there was a fight. Despite the carnage, Boudot said his general lack of faith in humanity was renewed by the actions that followed from those around him: A stranger “wrapped their arms around all four of my kids because my wife’s in shock," and an elderly man applied the tourniquet.

Article: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has agreed to provide to Congress documents from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, a key House lawmaker said Monday in announcing a move that appears to avert, at least temporarily, a potential separation of powers clash. The records are to be turned over starting Friday to the House Oversight Committee, which earlier this month issued a broad subpoena to the Justice Department about a criminal case that has long captivated public attention, recently roiled the top rungs of President Donald Trump's administration and been a consistent magnet for conspiracy theories. “There are many records in DOJ’s custody, and it will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,” Kentucky Rep. It also demanded records about communications between Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein, as well as documents related to an earlier federal investigation into Epstein in Florida that resulted in a non-prosecution agreement. It was not clear exactly which or how many documents might be produced or whether the cooperation with Congress reflected a broader change in posture since last month, when the FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing any additional records from the Epstein investigation after determining that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted." That announcement put the Trump administration on the defensive, with officials since then scrambling both to tamp down angry questions from the president's base and also laboring to appear transparent. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell at a Florida courthouse over two days last month — though no records from those conversations have been made public — and the Justice Department has also sought to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases, though so far those requests have been denied.

Article: Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit Monday against a ticket broker, alleging the company used illegal tactics to exceed purchasing limits for popular events and then resold tickets at significantly higher prices. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, the FTC said Maryland-based ticket broker Key Investment Group has used thousands of fictitious Ticketmaster accounts and other methods to buy tickets for events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. According to the FTC, Key Investment Group – which does business under brand names like Epic Seats and Totally Tix – purchased at least 379,776 tickets from Ticketmaster between Nov. For just one Taylor Swift concert, Key Investment Group allegedly used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets, dramatically exceeding the Eras Tour’s 2023 six-ticket purchase limit per event, the FTC said. Key Investment Group said the FTC is misapplying the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, a 2016 law which it said was meant to target malicious software, not legitimate resale businesses. Key Investment Group sued the FTC in July to try to prevent the agency from using the law against it, saying it uses human employees — not bots — to buy tickets. The order also directed the FTC to ensure “price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process” and to “take enforcement action to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary ticketing market."

Article: TORONTO, ON — The union for 10,000 striking Air Canada flight attendants said Monday they won’t return to work even though the strike, now in its third day, has been declared illegal. The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada’s labor laws, had said the union needed to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties. Our members want a solution here, but solution has to be found at the bargaining table.” It was not immediately clear what recourse the board or the government have if the union continues to refuse. Labor leaders are objecting to the Canadian government’s repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere. “I urge both parties to resolve this as quickly as possible.” Carney said it was disappointing that the talks have not led to a deal, and he stressed it was important that flight attendants are compensated fairly at all times. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout. “We’re obviously hoping we can go tomorrow, but we’ll make that decision later today,” Rousseau said on BNN Bloomberg shortly after the union announced it would continue with the strike. Disrupted tourists, stranded passengers Montreal resident Robert Brzymowski has been stranded in Prague along with his wife and their two children since Saturday, when Air Canada canceled their flight home from what was meant to be a two-week vacation visiting relatives. Brzymowski, who consults businesses on energy-efficient practices, said he was set to start a new job Monday but lost out on the contract because he wasn’t back in Montreal in time. The worst thing is the amount of anxiety it’s caused.” Frustrated by what he described as a lack of communication from the airline, Brzymowski said he went to the airport in Prague on Monday morning in search of answers. Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren’t in the air. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

At his opening appearance in the Oval Office, Zelensky spoke little - or maybe he was not keen to, fearing that what he had to say was different from what Trump wanted to hear. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron both said a ceasefire in Ukraine should be the next step, even though Trump had argued that it was not necessary before a more permanent solution is found. Getty Images What we heard from the leaders suggests that their discussions behind closed doors focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and prospects for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin. At an earlier news conference outside the White House, he said security guarantees could include a $90bn (£67bn) deal between Kyiv and Washington to acquire US weapons, including aviation systems, anti-missile systems and other weapons he declined to disclose. The Ukranian leader, however, was more willing to talk about his possible meeting with Putin, telling reporters he was ready to meet directly with his Russian counterpart, and if Moscow agreed, Trump could join the negotiations.

Lawyers for Boyd filed a federal lawsuit in July — about a month after the state began asking for his execution date — seeking to prevent the state from executing him with nitrogen. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser who witnessed the first nitrogen execution and is now working with Boyd, said Monday that he was “horrified” by what he saw at that execution, which he described as being “suffocated to death.” The Alabama attorney general’s office has urged a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that there is “substantial evidence that nitrogen hypoxia is a painless way to die.” The state argued the described movements in previous executions were either inmates actively resisting or “involuntary movements associated with dying.” Huguley’s burned body was found Aug.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to convene a face-to-face summit between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his latest bid to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s proposal on Monday came as he hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, at the White House for high-stakes talks on ending the conflict, which has raged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said he had “begun arrangements” for the summit after speaking with Putin by phone, and that he would hold a trilateral meeting with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts following their two-way meeting. “Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte separately confirmed that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, but did not specify a date or location. Moscow did not immediately confirm that it had agreed to a summit, but Russia’s state-run TASS news agency cited presidential aide Yuri Ushakov as saying that Putin and Trump “spoke in favour of continuing direct talks” between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Advertisement The proposals for a summit, which would be the first meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy since Moscow’s invasion, came as the fraught issue of security guarantees for Ukraine took centre stage during the talks at the White House. Asked if the US could send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Trump said that European countries would be the “first line of defence”, but that Washington would provide “a lot of help”. While Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, his special envoy, Witkoff, said on Sunday that Putin was open to a security guarantee resembling the 32-member alliance’s collective defence mandate. Speaking on Fox News after Monday’s talks, Rutte called Washington’s commitment to be involved in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security a “breakthrough”, but said the exact nature of that involvement would be discussed over the coming days. “What we all agree on is that if this war does come to end… it has to be definitive – that Russia will never, ever, ever again try to get a catch a square mile of territory of Ukraine post a peace deal,” Rutte said. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian exile and Putin critic who is a professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that meaningful security guarantees for Kyiv would need to include European troops on the ground. “This is all ‘unacceptable’ to Putin, so for European leaders, it is the question how to persuade President Trump that without such guarantees, the war, even if it stops now, will start again in the near future,” Sonin told Al Jazeera. “Russia has signed many international treaties recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders – including Putin himself signing one such treaty in 2004 – and still violated all of these treaties, both in 2014 and 2022,” Sonin said. And that’s been true in every war.” Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly ruled out handing over Ukrainian territory to Moscow, said on Monday that land would be an issue for him and Putin to work out between them.

Article: There must be a push for peace to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, but French President Emmanuel Macron is skeptical that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to resolve the conflict. “When I look at the situation and the facts, I don’t see President Putin very willing to get peace now,” Macron told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview Monday after a high-stakes White House meeting Monday. So if he considers he can get a deal done, this is great news, and we have to do whatever we can to have a great deal.” Macron insisted that the United States must apply pressure to Russia and Putin to find a resolution, including introducing more sanctions. If there is no progress in the bilateral meeting President Donald Trump announced between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and if a trilateral meeting falls through, “or if the Russians don’t comply with this approach, yes, we have to increase the sanctions, secondary and primary sanctions,” Macron said. There is a country which decided to kill people, stole children and who refused a ceasefire and peace, so we cannot just create an equivalent situation between Ukraine and Russia.” Ukraine must be given security guarantees to prevent any future Russian attacks that could prolong the conflict or start a new war, Macron said after his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and top European leaders. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Macron said, “I do hope,” noting that Russia carried out strikes in Ukraine even as the delegation of world leaders was in the United States. Putin kept up the pressure in the lead-up to the talks with deadly attacks in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia overnight, seemingly trying to push Zelenskyy to meet what are thought to be sweeping demands for Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Macron said there should not be any land swapping, as Trump has suggested, particularly because there have been long periods during the Russian-started war that its military was not able make significant gains in taking control of Ukrainian land. “What’s happening in Ukraine is extremely important for Ukrainian people, obviously, but for the whole security of Europe, because we speak about containing a nuclear power, which decided just not to respect international borders anymore.

HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- A Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable seen in a video pulling a gun following a family dispute remains under investigation as her attorney says the public is only seeing part of the story. Brown, who was in uniform at the time but off duty, according to Precinct 1, is seen pointing a firearm at the man while demanding the return of her sister's phone. The man recording the incident told ABC13 that he had taken the phone during an argument with the mother of his child, Brown's sister, and was later confronted by Brown herself, who allegedly chased him down in her personal vehicle. "At that time, she believed her sister had been assaulted and kidnapped by the perpetrator." According to Bolin, Brown first called Harris County Precinct 4 for help to respond to her sister's address but then saw her phone in motion via a tracking app and feared she had been taken against her will. When she realized her sister wasn't in that vehicle, she took the phone that was her sister's and continued to check on her well-being." The one-minute video does not include any mention of Brown's concern for her sister's whereabouts. Prior to that, she was employed by the Lone Star College Police Department, where records obtained by ABC13 through an open records request, show she had been disciplined for conduct violations, including the use of profanity.

Article: Nicole Collier must remain on the floor of the Texas House of Representatives after declining to sign a document Monday that would assign her a law enforcement escort to monitor her movements across the state, according to a news release. Earlier this month, dozens of House Democrats left the state, many to Chicago, to prevent a quorum and stall a special legislative session focused on redrawing the state’s congressional maps. Collier, a seven-term lawmaker and former chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus who represents a majority-minority district, said she will not submit to what she described as intimidation tactics. “I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts,” Collier said in a statement. "When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” Democratic colleagues have voiced support for Collier’s decision and called on House leadership to restore public access to the chamber galleries, which were closed during the standoff.

Article: The rebrand, announced yesterday, aims to create distance between the liberal news network—home to Rachel Maddow, Ari Melber, and Nicole Wallace—and NBC Universal, which owns NBC, amid an ongoing corporate divorce. The name change comes as part of the process that started last November of spinning off MSNBC and other NBCU cable network properties, including the Golf Channel, E!, and CNBC, into a new company called Versant. MSNBC, which got its original name from a now-defunct partnership between NBC and Microsoft, has been on a quest to forge an independent identity as its opinion journalism with a progressive slant has created headaches for NBC, which has maintained a more neutral editorial tone. Not just a name change Like an adult in their early 20s finally moving from their parents’ house, MSNBC is in the process of becoming operationally self-sufficient as it separates from its corporate cousin, NBC. The two networks are moving away from sharing on-air talent, and MSNBC has been on a hiring spree to beef up its newsgathering prowess so it doesn’t have to rely on NBC for scoops. Aside from new-hire editors and producers, it recently brought on several NBC News personalities, including correspondents Jacob Soboroff and Vaughn Hillyard, as well as political reporters from Politico and the Washington Post. Big picture: Though MSNBC does well in the nightly eyeballs game—surpassing CNN to receive the second-highest primetime ratings among cable news channels—it lags behind Fox News, which had more than double the primetime viewers last quarter, according to Nielsen Live+SD data.—SK

(AP Photo/Adlai Coleman) Michael Deng Dut, 29 years-old, who says he was electrocuted more than 18 times after his arrest by the Sudanese Armed Forces, poses for a photo during an interview with The Associated Press in Renk, South Sudan, Thursday, Aug 7, 2025. This July, he finally crossed the border back into his native South Sudan, taking a deep breath and reminding himself, “I am alive.” After everything that has happened to him, it feels like a miracle. Sudan — once his place of refuge — has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023 that has killed 40,000 people and displaced nearly 13 million more, according to UN agencies. There had been incursions into the area by the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force once known as the Janjaweed who were notorious for mass killings, rapes and other atrocities in Darfur two decades ago. More recently, the RSF have again been accused of by the International Criminal Court of committing war crimes, including the attacks on famine-hit Zamzam and other camps in North Darfur. human rights body detailed how both the SAF and the RSF have detained tens of thousands of people “without charge, with limited or no contact with their families, in squalid and overcrowded facilities” in “a widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment.” Abdullah can attest to this. “Even when you shouted to them,” said Abdullah, “they would tell you, ‘if you want to die also, you can die with them.’” The Associated Press spoke to eight men in total, some of whom were detained in other prisons in Al Jazirah State and Khartoum. One man, Michael Deng Dut, 29, said he had been “tortured with electricity more than 18 times.” Simon Tong, 39, said that he was tortured with a knife during an interrogation, and rolled up his sleeve to expose the scars on his arm. “This is the reason many of us passed away,” said Tong, “because of the lack of food and water.” In July, 99 South Sudanese prisoners were separated from the other inmates. When the Sudanese civil war broke out in 2023, UN agencies and the South Sudanese government established an onward transportation program which has moved more than 250,000 people, according to the UN’s International Office of Migration. “All of us, together.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Article: House maps to his advantage Democrats get police escorts to prevent a new redistricting walkout as California moves to retaliate By BILL BARROW Associated Press , TRAN NGUYEN Associated Press , FERNANDA FIGUEROA Associated Press , and JOHN HANNA Associated Press Texas Troopers gather in the gallery of the House Chamber at the Texas Capitol after a second special session was gaveled in, Monday, Aug. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats who ended a walkout found themselves shadowed by law enforcement officers to keep them from repeating the protest that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts and fulfill President Donald Trump's desire to reshape U.S. Republicans in the Texas House forced returning Democrats to sign what the Democrats called “permission slips,” agreeing to around-the-clock surveillance by state Department of Public Safety officers to leave the floor. "This is a waste of taxpayer dollars and really performative theater.” Collier, who represents a minority-majority district, said she would not “sign away my dignity" and allow Republicans to “control my movements and monitor me.” “I know these maps will harm my constituents,” she said in a statement. "I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” The tit-for-tat puts the nation's two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. “We don’t want this fight, but with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight,” said Democrat Marc Berman, a California Assembly member who previously chaired the elections committee. Greg Abbott launched the expanding battle when he heeded Trump's wishes and added redistricting to an initial special session agenda that included multiple issues, including a package responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98 WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said. Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. “Politics Today” began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001. Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book “85 Days.” Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as “friendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains” who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse’s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, “Boys on the Bus.” When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, “we often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it “the most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.” But he did not blame that view for The Sun’s dropping his column. “The war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,” he wrote for the Poynter Institute’s blog. Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training.

Article: Nkrumah was opposed and derided by some fellow African leaders for what they saw as his unrealistic dream of merging dozens of newly formed countries to form a continental government, perhaps with him at the helm. The Ghanaian leader saw this move toward larger units, both economically and politically, as a matter of successive voluntary steps — with states joining to integrate their markets and road and rail networks, then perhaps merging at the subregional level before any eventual attempt to form a nation that would encompass, say, all of West, East or Southern Africa. This was the future he saw for his continent, as he explained to his peers at the founding summit of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1963.

Article: Alex Livesey | Getty Images European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie. You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts." According to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. Private equity More than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research. But the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is "starting to crack down on clubs." This summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. Moura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an "injustice" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions. The growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income "plateauing" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights. That has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches. Maguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games "will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli." The Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is "very different" from American peers when it comes to international games.

Article: adults in professional jobs found that 91% of Gen Z said it would be nice to have a balance of virtual and in-person events to connect with others at their company and in their industry. "In general, young people seek the social atmosphere because many of them just graduated college or are a few years out and are looking for similar social conveniences," Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, explained. Canary Wharf, London's privately owned financial district, which houses companies like JPMorgan, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley, launched the Wharf Connect networking program in 2024 for professionals in the first 10 years of their career. "Part of the return-to-office push is that young people, especially, yearn for those connections, and relative to older generations, they are much more isolated and lonely, so return to office at least partially allows them to meet their coworkers," Schawbel said. Last week, I took a trip to Canary Wharf to attend a Xiao Long Bao (dumpling) masterclass at Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung — an event organized by Wharf Connect. Walking into a dining room nestled at the back of the restaurant where the workshop was taking place, I was stunned to see how busy it was with over 50 young professionals in attendance and chattering away. Before starting his job in the Canary Wharf area, he was already seeking out social events or communities that would allow him to socialize and mingle outside of the workplace, but they left much to be desired. "So I go into the office as many times a week as I can…working from home after Covid has been a bit s--- like I'll go into the office three or four times a week and most of my team won't be in," Haria said.

Article: Jenny Southan, CEO of travel trend forecasting agency Globetrender, described the summer of 2025 as "a turning point for European tourism, underscoring that no destination is truly immune to climate volatility." Extreme heat is made much more likely by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels. Miguel Riopa | Afp | Getty Images Heatwaves and wildfires across popular vacation destinations in Spain, Portugal and Greece have taken their toll on local infrastructure in recent weeks, triggering mass evacuations and shuttering beaches. Alarmingly high temperatures have also been recorded in Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, posing a direct challenge to the notion that northern Europe "offers guaranteed relief" in peak summer, Southan told CNBC by email. "This double blow has accelerated a behavioural shift already in motion: travellers are avoiding the most intense heat periods, favouring cooler coastal or alpine locations, moving trips to spring and autumn, and experimenting with higher-latitude destinations from the Baltics to the Scottish Highlands," Southan said. The ETC found that heightened concern about overcrowding had prompted tourists to spend their 2025 summer vacations in less popular or off-the-beaten track destinations, while interest in traditional hotspots has declined. "Our latest data shows that, even amid shifting economic and social realities, Europeans are not willing to compromise on travel, and they increasingly prefer quieter destinations and trips outside peak seasons," ETC President Miguel Sanz said in a statement.

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images Another one of the winners to emerge from the coolcations trend has been the small central European country of Slovenia, which has received growing interest in higher altitude, cooler destinations. Southern European countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are all heavily reliant on tourism, with the latest available data showing the sector accounted for 18%, 12.3% and 11.9% of gross domestic product, respectively. Linda Jonczyk, a spokesperson for TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, said the company was seeing growing interest in Nordic destinations such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden due to the coolcations trend. "Classic sun and beach destinations around the Mediterranean continue to be high in demand – Spain, Greece and Turkey are and remain the undisputed favourites," Jonczyk told CNBC by email.
