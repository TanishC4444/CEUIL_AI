Article: United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to convene a face-to-face summit between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his latest bid to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s proposal on Monday came as he hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, at the White House for high-stakes talks on ending the conflict, which has raged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said he had “begun arrangements” for the summit after speaking with Putin by phone, and that he would hold a trilateral meeting with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts following their two-way meeting. “Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte separately confirmed that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, but did not specify a date or location. Moscow did not immediately confirm that it had agreed to a summit, but Russia’s state-run TASS news agency cited presidential aide Yuri Ushakov as saying that Putin and Trump “spoke in favour of continuing direct talks” between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Advertisement The proposals for a summit, which would be the first meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy since Moscow’s invasion, came as the fraught issue of security guarantees for Ukraine took centre stage during the talks at the White House. Asked if the US could send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Trump said that European countries would be the “first line of defence”, but that Washington would provide “a lot of help”. While Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, his special envoy, Witkoff, said on Sunday that Putin was open to a security guarantee resembling the 32-member alliance’s collective defence mandate. Speaking on Fox News after Monday’s talks, Rutte called Washington’s commitment to be involved in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security a “breakthrough”, but said the exact nature of that involvement would be discussed over the coming days. “What we all agree on is that if this war does come to end… it has to be definitive – that Russia will never, ever, ever again try to get a catch a square mile of territory of Ukraine post a peace deal,” Rutte said. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian exile and Putin critic who is a professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that meaningful security guarantees for Kyiv would need to include European troops on the ground. “This is all ‘unacceptable’ to Putin, so for European leaders, it is the question how to persuade President Trump that without such guarantees, the war, even if it stops now, will start again in the near future,” Sonin told Al Jazeera. “Russia has signed many international treaties recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders – including Putin himself signing one such treaty in 2004 – and still violated all of these treaties, both in 2014 and 2022,” Sonin said. And that’s been true in every war.” Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly ruled out handing over Ukrainian territory to Moscow, said on Monday that land would be an issue for him and Putin to work out between them.

Article: There must be a push for peace to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, but French President Emmanuel Macron is skeptical that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to resolve the conflict. “When I look at the situation and the facts, I don’t see President Putin very willing to get peace now,” Macron told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview Monday after a high-stakes White House meeting Monday. So if he considers he can get a deal done, this is great news, and we have to do whatever we can to have a great deal.” Macron insisted that the United States must apply pressure to Russia and Putin to find a resolution, including introducing more sanctions. If there is no progress in the bilateral meeting President Donald Trump announced between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and if a trilateral meeting falls through, “or if the Russians don’t comply with this approach, yes, we have to increase the sanctions, secondary and primary sanctions,” Macron said. There is a country which decided to kill people, stole children and who refused a ceasefire and peace, so we cannot just create an equivalent situation between Ukraine and Russia.” Ukraine must be given security guarantees to prevent any future Russian attacks that could prolong the conflict or start a new war, Macron said after his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and top European leaders. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Macron said, “I do hope,” noting that Russia carried out strikes in Ukraine even as the delegation of world leaders was in the United States. Putin kept up the pressure in the lead-up to the talks with deadly attacks in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia overnight, seemingly trying to push Zelenskyy to meet what are thought to be sweeping demands for Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Macron said there should not be any land swapping, as Trump has suggested, particularly because there have been long periods during the Russian-started war that its military was not able make significant gains in taking control of Ukrainian land. “What’s happening in Ukraine is extremely important for Ukrainian people, obviously, but for the whole security of Europe, because we speak about containing a nuclear power, which decided just not to respect international borders anymore.

Article: AUSTIN, Texas — The families of 27 Camp Mystic campers who died in the catastrophic Hill Country floods in July met with Texas' top leaders at the state capitol Thursday to continue pushing for change. "We are here to make sure no other parent in Texas gets that phone call - the one that changes everything, but could have been prevented." In a news release, the group of parents said they are continuing to call for an investigation into what happened at Camp Mystic. They're also pushing for legislators to implement various changes, including the following: Moving structures away from flood plains and hazardous areas Requiring camps to maintain emergency detection plans with 24/7 monitoring and adequate notification systems for emergencies Establishing standards for evacuation plans, including requiring emergency drills for campers and staff Requiring emergency management divisions to formally trigger camp-site responses The coalition of parents said the state leaders affirmed their commitment to taking action on behalf of the victims.

A Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable seen in a video pulling a gun following a family dispute remains under investigation as her attorney says the public is only seeing part of the story. HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- A Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable seen in a video pulling a gun following a family dispute remains under investigation as her attorney says the public is only seeing part of the story. Brown, who was in uniform at the time but off duty, according to Precinct 1, is seen pointing a firearm at the man while demanding the return of her sister's phone. The man recording the incident told ABC13 that he had taken the phone during an argument with the mother of his child, Brown's sister, and was later confronted by Brown herself, who allegedly chased him down in her personal vehicle. "At that time, she believed her sister had been assaulted and kidnapped by the perpetrator." According to Bolin, Brown first called Harris County Precinct 4 for help to respond to her sister's address but then saw her phone in motion via a tracking app and feared she had been taken against her will. When she realized her sister wasn't in that vehicle, she took the phone that was her sister's and continued to check on her well-being." The one-minute video does not include any mention of Brown's concern for her sister's whereabouts. Prior to that, she was employed by the Lone Star College Police Department, where records obtained by ABC13 through an open records request, show she had been disciplined for conduct violations, including the use of profanity.

Article: The announcement came just hours after new reports that the Trump administration is in talks to take a stake of around 10% in Intel by converting government grants into shares. "The investment comes as both Intel and SoftBank deepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States," the two companies said in a joint statement. On Thursday, the company declined to comment on the reported discussions and said it was "deeply committed to supporting President Trump's efforts" to strengthen manufacturing and technology in the US. Such an agreement would mark a "major escalation" in what seems to be an attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the US government's role in the private sector, said political scientist Sarah Bauerle Danzman from Indiana University.

Article: Nicole Collier must remain on the floor of the Texas House of Representatives after declining to sign a document Monday that would assign her a law enforcement escort to monitor her movements across the state, according to a news release. Earlier this month, dozens of House Democrats left the state, many to Chicago, to prevent a quorum and stall a special legislative session focused on redrawing the state’s congressional maps. Collier, a seven-term lawmaker and former chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus who represents a majority-minority district, said she will not submit to what she described as intimidation tactics. “I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts,” Collier said in a statement. "When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” Democratic colleagues have voiced support for Collier’s decision and called on House leadership to restore public access to the chamber galleries, which were closed during the standoff.

Article: The rebrand, announced yesterday, aims to create distance between the liberal news network—home to Rachel Maddow, Ari Melber, and Nicole Wallace—and NBC Universal, which owns NBC, amid an ongoing corporate divorce. The name change comes as part of the process that started last November of spinning off MSNBC and other NBCU cable network properties, including the Golf Channel, E!, and CNBC, into a new company called Versant. MSNBC, which got its original name from a now-defunct partnership between NBC and Microsoft, has been on a quest to forge an independent identity as its opinion journalism with a progressive slant has created headaches for NBC, which has maintained a more neutral editorial tone. Not just a name change Like an adult in their early 20s finally moving from their parents’ house, MSNBC is in the process of becoming operationally self-sufficient as it separates from its corporate cousin, NBC. The two networks are moving away from sharing on-air talent, and MSNBC has been on a hiring spree to beef up its newsgathering prowess so it doesn’t have to rely on NBC for scoops. Aside from new-hire editors and producers, it recently brought on several NBC News personalities, including correspondents Jacob Soboroff and Vaughn Hillyard, as well as political reporters from Politico and the Washington Post. Big picture: Though MSNBC does well in the nightly eyeballs game—surpassing CNN to receive the second-highest primetime ratings among cable news channels—it lags behind Fox News, which had more than double the primetime viewers last quarter, according to Nielsen Live+SD data.—SK

(AP Photo/Adlai Coleman) Michael Deng Dut, 29 years-old, who says he was electrocuted more than 18 times after his arrest by the Sudanese Armed Forces, poses for a photo during an interview with The Associated Press in Renk, South Sudan, Thursday, Aug 7, 2025. This July, he finally crossed the border back into his native South Sudan, taking a deep breath and reminding himself, “I am alive.” After everything that has happened to him, it feels like a miracle. Sudan — once his place of refuge — has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023 that has killed 40,000 people and displaced nearly 13 million more, according to UN agencies. There had been incursions into the area by the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force once known as the Janjaweed who were notorious for mass killings, rapes and other atrocities in Darfur two decades ago. More recently, the RSF have again been accused of by the International Criminal Court of committing war crimes, including the attacks on famine-hit Zamzam and other camps in North Darfur. human rights body detailed how both the SAF and the RSF have detained tens of thousands of people “without charge, with limited or no contact with their families, in squalid and overcrowded facilities” in “a widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment.” Abdullah can attest to this. “Even when you shouted to them,” said Abdullah, “they would tell you, ‘if you want to die also, you can die with them.’” The Associated Press spoke to eight men in total, some of whom were detained in other prisons in Al Jazirah State and Khartoum. One man, Michael Deng Dut, 29, said he had been “tortured with electricity more than 18 times.” Simon Tong, 39, said that he was tortured with a knife during an interrogation, and rolled up his sleeve to expose the scars on his arm. “This is the reason many of us passed away,” said Tong, “because of the lack of food and water.” In July, 99 South Sudanese prisoners were separated from the other inmates. When the Sudanese civil war broke out in 2023, UN agencies and the South Sudanese government established an onward transportation program which has moved more than 250,000 people, according to the UN’s International Office of Migration. “All of us, together.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats who ended a walkout found themselves shadowed by law enforcement officers to keep them from repeating the protest that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts and fulfill President Donald Trump's desire to reshape U.S. Republicans in the Texas House forced returning Democrats to sign what the Democrats called “permission slips,” agreeing to around-the-clock surveillance by state Department of Public Safety officers to leave the floor. "This is a waste of taxpayer dollars and really performative theater.” Collier, who represents a minority-majority district, said she would not “sign away my dignity" and allow Republicans to “control my movements and monitor me.” “I know these maps will harm my constituents,” she said in a statement. "I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” The tit-for-tat puts the nation's two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. “We don’t want this fight, but with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight,” said Democrat Marc Berman, a California Assembly member who previously chaired the elections committee. Greg Abbott launched the expanding battle when he heeded Trump's wishes and added redistricting to an initial special session agenda that included multiple issues, including a package responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98 WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said. Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. “Politics Today” began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001. Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book “85 Days.” Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as “friendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains” who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse’s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, “Boys on the Bus.” When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, “we often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it “the most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.” But he did not blame that view for The Sun’s dropping his column. “The war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,” he wrote for the Poynter Institute’s blog. Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training.

The Ghanaian leader saw this move toward larger units, both economically and politically, as a matter of successive voluntary steps — with states joining to integrate their markets and road and rail networks, then perhaps merging at the subregional level before any eventual attempt to form a nation that would encompass, say, all of West, East or Southern Africa. This was the future he saw for his continent, as he explained to his peers at the founding summit of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1963.

Article: Alex Livesey | Getty Images European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie. You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts." According to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. Private equity More than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research. But the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is "starting to crack down on clubs." This summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. Moura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an "injustice" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions. The growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income "plateauing" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights. That has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches. Maguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games "will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli." The Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is "very different" from American peers when it comes to international games.

Article: Jenny Southan, CEO of travel trend forecasting agency Globetrender, described the summer of 2025 as "a turning point for European tourism, underscoring that no destination is truly immune to climate volatility." Extreme heat is made much more likely by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels. Miguel Riopa | Afp | Getty Images Heatwaves and wildfires across popular vacation destinations in Spain, Portugal and Greece have taken their toll on local infrastructure in recent weeks, triggering mass evacuations and shuttering beaches. Alarmingly high temperatures have also been recorded in Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, posing a direct challenge to the notion that northern Europe "offers guaranteed relief" in peak summer, Southan told CNBC by email. "This double blow has accelerated a behavioural shift already in motion: travellers are avoiding the most intense heat periods, favouring cooler coastal or alpine locations, moving trips to spring and autumn, and experimenting with higher-latitude destinations from the Baltics to the Scottish Highlands," Southan said. The ETC found that heightened concern about overcrowding had prompted tourists to spend their 2025 summer vacations in less popular or off-the-beaten track destinations, while interest in traditional hotspots has declined. "Our latest data shows that, even amid shifting economic and social realities, Europeans are not willing to compromise on travel, and they increasingly prefer quieter destinations and trips outside peak seasons," ETC President Miguel Sanz said in a statement.
